pick
up
with
Olwin
that

do
you
say
what
do
you
think
well
you
can
pretend
it

a
bubble
if
you
want
perhaps
you
would
better
get
everything
out_of

before
you
sit
in
there
because
you
might
be
squashing
things
do
you
want

little
trolleys
at
Centre_Parcs
but
we
are
going
somewhere
like
Centre_Parcs
called
Oasis
and
I
do
not
know
if
they
will
have
little
trolleys
there
they
will
have
a
big
swimming
pool
it
is
like
Centre_Parcs
but
it
is
not
the
same
it
is
very
similar
but
it
is
in
a
different
place
and
it
will
be
posher
and
nicer
maybe
maybe
well
yeah
put
it
in
the
trolley
and
then
in
the
bag
when
you
have
paid
the
lady
or
the
man
think
it
will
be
a
lady
mhm
we
will
go
swimming
we
will
go
swimming

else
do
we
do
there
we
will
go
to
see
Uncle_Mark
on
the
way
be
not
we
you
will
not
swim
with
Mark
we
will
just
see
Mark
Mark's
got
a
big
clock
like
our
clock
do
you
remember
it
where
you
have_to
knock
on
the
door
and
you
knock
on
it
do
not
you
and
he
opens
it
for
you
knock
you
look
at
the
pendulum
going
tick
and
when
we
went
to
see
Mark
last
time
we
went
to
see
Father_Christmas
on
a
train
do
you
remember
that
round
and
round
train
no
it
was
not
a
round
and
round
train
it
was
a
proper
steam
train
like
Thomas
and
Father_Christmas
came
to
see
us
and
then
we
got
stuck
in
snow
do
you
remember
that
do
you
remember
that
it
was
terrible
the
car
was
slipping
and
sliding
all
over
the
place
and
we
nearly
crashed
lots_of
times
did
not
we
crash
like
that
and
then
on
the
way
back
we
are
going
to
see
Chris
what
does
Chris
make
a
car
like
that
one
what
does
Chris
make
with
you
what
do
you
do
what
do
you
do
that
is
right
we
are
going
to
see
him
he
likes
in
Leeds
and
then
we
might
go
to
Eureka
you
know
Eureka
you
you
would
not
like
to
go
it
is
a
museum
where
there
is
lots_of
things
for
you
to
do
um
I
do
not
think
Chris
will
have
many
toys
but
we
might
take
some
with
us
lady's
toys
Chris
might
have
a
few
toys
I
think
he
is
got
a
Paddington_Bear
that
his
Mummy
made
him
when
he
was
a
little
boy
yeah
you
want
to
look
at
Chris's
bed
what
the
one
he
slept
in
when
he
came
here
he
is
going
to
make
you
a
special
bed
on
the
floor
mhm
well
I
do
not
think
it
will
be
like
that
one
bit
bit
bigger
than
that
and
um
we
might
go
shopping
in
Leeds
again
because
Mummy
likes
it
there
and
spends
lots_of
money
would
that
be
good
to
go
shopping
in
Leeds
we
might
see
Uncle_Daniel
mhm
but
he
never
turns
up
so
we
may
not
bother
knock
on
the
door
whose
door
Daniel's
door
well
I
do
not
know
if
we
will
bother
telling
him
we
are
going
because
he
never
turns
up
in
time
does
he
he
is
a
bit
dopey
your
my
brother
did
did
you
know
that
Daniel
is
Mummy's
brother
like
Andy's
your
brother
Daniel's
my
brother
what
is
Caroline
called
oh
Richard
oh
mhm
do
you
think
Andy
might
be
a
doctor
one
day
do
you
think
just
a
Gail
good
girl
very
sensible
Becky
do
you
remember
Becky
Becky's
Mummy's
cousin
she
is
at
college
learning
how
to
be
a
doctor
so
one
day
she
will
be
a
doctor
Doctor_Becky
she
might
do
if
you
were
poorly
yeah
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
long
way
for
her
to
come
because
where
are
we
next
week
we
are
on
holiday
we
are
