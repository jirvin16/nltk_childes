you
think
Daniel
might
come
this
is
where
it
gets
awkward
does
not
it
because
I
do
not
know
even
know
who
Daniel
is
www
www
what
a
big
tower
you
are
building
my
word
did
you
do
that
all
yourself
www
did
it

broken
in

places
think
your
tower's
too
tall
do
you
did
you
the

the
only
people
person
that

color's
that
one
goodness
knows
did
you
it
is

was
it
that
is
a
surprise
my
word
that
is
tall
that
is
nearly
as
tall
as
you
is
not
it
oh
if
it
did
not
keep
flopping
around
you
can
put
those
on
one
side
and
those
on
the
other
could
not
