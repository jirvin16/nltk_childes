a
bit
nervous
mhm
it

went
round
and
round
bumpy
bumpy
and
we
were
stuck
at
the
back
and
it
was
very
hot
was
not
it
so
we
got
off

then
you
started
feeling
better
did
not
you
yeah
and
what
did
we
buy
at
that
little
shop
because
you
would
been
a
good
girl
for
it
did
did
not
he
bought
you
a
little
hat
for

did
not
we
mhm
it

in
the
bag
was
not
it
yeah
think
it
will
be
there
if

was
was
not
it
we
are
going
to
a
different
place
be
not
we
in
May
and
do
you
know
what
the
different
place
is
called
that
is
right
Majorca
that
is
right
and
we
have
got
our
own
little
house
and
what
is
it
got
it
is
own
what
is
it
got
it
is
own
swimming
pool
swimming
pool
I
think
and
the
water
was
very
very
cold
in
Lanzarotte

not
it
Andy
did
not
like
it
did
he
mhm
you
did
he

they
so
cold
the
different
one

did
we
buy
to
go
in
the
pool
with
you
