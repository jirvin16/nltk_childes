they're putting in new pipes you know

make our radiators work properly
they are
and you know what they did the other day
we didn't see it
but the men that were digging
there was a pipe under the ground with water in it to bring water so_that you can flush the loo and have a bath
and the men chopped through a pipe
and the water went everywhere
and it flooded into some people's houses
just down the road
some people opened their front door and all this water came rushing in
no
but two people rang Mummy and they thought it was at our house
no
we were lucky
it was just down the road though
I didn't
I I said to them no
there's no water round here
it was only about fifty yards away
yeah
that would've been a disaster wouldn't it
it would've rushed in
and it might've got in their tellie
and all our carpets
on the buggy

his hat fell off did it
in the wind
where did it land

did he have_to come down the ladder and get it
what hole
oh right
he could reach through could he
and got it
oh
that was clever
do you think we need our tree chopping
mhm
you know that tree used to be absolutely enormous
our tree did
before we came it used to be as high as the house
and they chopped it down
and then it started to grow again
before we lived here
absolutely enormous it was
mhm
it was taller than the house I think
and when the cut it down they had to close the road
they had to say no cars can come down this road because we're chopping this big tree down
that must've been good mustn't it
yeah
oh
oh dear
we've lost all Caroline's toys

do you think she might not notice
