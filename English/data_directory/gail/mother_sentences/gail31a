that's one thing that you're pretty good at
cutting
when I went to play to help out all the other children couldn't do it
I was most impressed
not that you cut anything very beautiful
but at least you've learnt how to do it
and those scissors are pretty tricky because Mummy can't cut anything with them
although I think we'll have_to take them with us
well
we'll take them with us so_that you can do cutting
but what might we need to wrap up when we're in Majorca
some presents for
I don't think there's much point wrapping them up before we go is there
so if we get there and we can buy some paper
no
Majorca we're going to aren't we
and who what did Mummy just tell you and it made you laugh lots
going going going going going going going going going going going going going going
John
in his taxi
yeah
you thought that was crazy didn't you
we're going in John's car to the airport
not Mummy's and not Daddy's
and why was there a knock on the door very early this morning
what did Daniel come and tell Daddy
something that you'd done
on what
yeah
and you'd left it down all night didn't you
mhm
last night you did
because Mummy let you play in the car while I was sitting on the doorstep watching you
but I didn't notice that you'd wound the window down
on the other side did I
and somebody could've come and pinched Beatty
couldn't they
going going going going going going going going going going going going
with his taxi
going going going going going going going going going going
Andy's car
and then Mummy and Daddy are going to get in
going going going going going going going going going going
will that be fun
yeah
Daddy'll sit next_to John and I'll have_to squeeze in the middle next_to you and Andy willn't I
like I did at Gagi's
tell you what
we've been to Tunbridge_Wells haven't we since
are you
that'll be lovely
what
what do you think he'll do with them
will he put them up on his wall
are you
now
what did we do in Tunbridge_Wells
who lives there
can you remember
is that where Gagi lives
what did we do that was very special there
we went to the Enchanted_forest didn't we
and what did we see there
coaches
in the car
you mean those caravan things
those that those people lived in
with the little cooker in
what else did you do
you went in
yeah
yeah
and what were those flowers called that we liked
that's right
and what did you say to Mummy which was ever so sweet
what did you say
that's what you said
you said do they ring didn't you
the bluebells
we couldn't hear them could we
they creak do they
oh
think the flowers could hear them ringing
no
then we went in that big tent
what was in that big tent
there was a fire wasn't there
was it
there there was smoke went out the top didn't it
that's right
there was a man playing his guitar wasn't there
remember him
and sing
was he singing as_well or not
no
I think he played the pipes didn't he
what else did we see
we saw those little houses for all those animals didn't we
by the river
do you remember
they had little front doors
they were a bit magic weren't they
what did we think lived in those
a bit like was it a bit like Tales_of_the_Riverbank and Brambley_Hedge
mhm
it was really good wasn't it
and what else did we see flying at the beginning
just when we set off
did we see an eagle
we did
yeah
yeah
I think he did
no
I do
yeah
what doesn't Gagi like
she doesn't like frogs does she
although she's got lots_of toy frogs in her house hasn't she
and what else did we do
oh
where did we go and play
where did you go climbing with Daddy
on the
on the rocks
yeah
Mummy used to climb there when she was a little girl
it's really good fun
did you
didn't didn't you get stuck
or not
mhm
I didn't want to go down
well
I was holding Andy wasn't I
because I'm always frightened of getting stuck
what else did we do when we were away
oh
what happened to Mummy
what we went to see that old man who's called Uncle_Daniel
but not Daniel_pots
a very very old Uncle_Daniel
and what did Mummy lose
mhm
and then we they found Mummy's purse didn't they
so Mummy was very pleased
but then what happened
yeah
did you think the doctors did it
yes
mhm
and Mummy was ever so pleased because they rang to say they'd found Mummy's purse didn't they
so I went and bought a box of chocolates for them to say thank_you for being so honest
and when I looked in it all my flipping money had gone
so I lose faith in humanity for a moment there
I was busy saying to your Daddy ninety nine percent of people are very honest
www

try again

but it hasn't arrived has it
we were going to give him a special tent weren't we
but they rang us and they haven't got any
we'll have_to get him something else
but to do that
think he'll still like a tent to play in
oh
think that's cheating a bit isn't it
what do you think Daddy'll do with all those bits
