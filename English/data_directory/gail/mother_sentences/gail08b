and what're we going to see
sniffer
going going going going going going going going going going
and bombs
in the courtroom
and we're going to see police
do you think
fishing in the canal
well
not
looking for something in the canal
and we might see Olwin
would you like to see Olwin
she'll be at work
you want to pick up with Olwin
that would be nice
she'd like that
but she'll be at work so it might be embarrassing if you run to the front of court and give her a big hug
but you can try
and who else'll we'll see
we'll see did we see Mummy's friend on the tellie
Peter didn't we yesterday
he was talking about it
on the tellie
and Mummy videoed it
because I suddenly saw Peter
Mummy's friend on the tellie talking about the Open_Day
what
on the tellie
no
I didn't video it darling
it was just on the tellie
an ordinary program
so the lion died at the end didn't he
she
a bit sad wasn't it
mhm
who else died last week
Diana
well remembered
didn't think you knew that
mind you
you've seen enough of it
are you in the bath
having a nice scrub
are there any bubbles in there
it's a bubble is it
I thought it was an onion
oh
that's not what you do is it
what do you say

what do you think
well
you can pretend it's a bubble if you want
perhaps you'd better get everything out_of that before you sit in there
because you might be squashing things
do you want to get out and take everything out first
no
you can get back
no
you can get back in
but tip everything out first
yeah
are you
where're we going on holiday
can you remember
France
what did you say
where're we going on holiday
with Mummy and Daddy and Andy
where're we going
that's right
yes
www
no
the ones with flags weren't there were they
the ones with flags were at the new Waitrose
at Granny's
at Newark
but they do have little trolleys at Centre_Parcs
but we're going somewhere like Centre_Parcs called Oasis
and I don't know if they'll have little trolleys there
they'll have a big swimming pool
it's like Centre_Parcs but it's not the same
it's very similar but it's in a different place
and it'll be posher
and nicer
maybe

maybe
well
yeah
put it in the trolley and then in the bag when you've paid the lady
or the man
think it'll be a lady
mhm
we'll go swimming
we'll go swimming
what else do we do there
we'll go to see Uncle_Mark on the way aren't we
you willn't swim with Mark
we'll just see Mark
Mark's got a big clock like our clock
do you remember it
where you have_to knock on the door
and you knock on it don't you
and he opens it for you
knock
you look at the pendulum going tick
and when we went to see Mark last time
we went to see Father_Christmas on a train
do you remember that
round and round train
no
it wasn't a round and round train
it was a proper steam train like Thomas
and Father_Christmas came to see us
and then we got stuck in snow
do you remember that
do you remember that
it was terrible
the car was slipping and sliding all over the place
and we nearly crashed lots_of times didn't we
crash like that
and then on the way back we're going to see Chris
what does Chris make
a car like that one
what does Chris make with you
what do you do
what do you do
that's right
we're going to see him
he likes in Leeds
and then we might go to Eureka
you know Eureka
you you wouldn't like to go
it's a museum where there's lots_of things for you to do
um I don't think Chris will have many toys but we might take some with us
lady's toys
Chris might have a few toys
I think he's got a Paddington_Bear
that his Mummy made him when he was a little boy
yeah
you want to look at Chris's bed
what
the one he slept in when he came here
he's going to make you a special bed on the floor
mhm

well
I don't think it'll be like that one
bit bit bigger than that
and um we might go shopping in Leeds again
because Mummy likes it there
and spends lots_of money
would that be good
to go shopping in Leeds
we might see Uncle_Daniel
mhm
but he never turns up so we may not bother
knock on the door
whose door
Daniel's door
well
I don't know if we'll bother telling him we're going
because he never turns up in time does he
he's a bit dopey your my brother
did did you know that Daniel is Mummy's brother
like Andy's your brother
Daniel's my brother

Becky's Mummy's cousin
she's at college learning how to be a doctor
so one day she'll be a doctor

do you think
it would be a long way for her to come
because where are we next week

we're away so Caroline can't come
because we're a long way away
yeah
so
Daddy's going to
pretend to eat it
oh
Daddy will be pleased to have a holiday willn't he
because he's been very very busy
he was a bit fed up
what did you say
Becky's learning how to be a doctor
she might do one day
I don't think she's ever been here actually
she's at Newcastle
that's where she's learning
and do you remember Simon
that's Becky's brother
going going going going going going going
when he can get a job
I don't think he'll come
doesn't seem very likely
maybe one day
mhm
he hasn't got a job at the moment
he's looking for a job
and who else do you know
no
you can't get in that one
because you'll squash all the books
which includes the library books
