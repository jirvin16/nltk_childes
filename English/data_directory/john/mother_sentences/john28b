and a train

oh there's a postcard from Aunty_Liz
move over and I'll read it
move over
now where's she been
she's been to Porloc in Devon
very old houses aren't they
they've got straw on the roof
what does she say
I hope you had a very relaxing birthday
and you enjoyed your meal Sarah
we're all having a great time
the house is lovely and we all want to buy it
we've been walking
I think that says drinking
and eating and sleeping all weekend
take care and we'll see you soon
love from Aunty_Liz and Richard
mhm
are you quite comfortable
are you
do you want to read a book while you're there
oh good
what did you ask for
oh
did you say please could I have an ice
and you have_to ask for the flavor
please could I have a strawberry ice you have_to say
and then you have_to give the man your money
and he will give you an ice
is it nice
do you want to read one of your books
John
are you quite happy
you're very cuddly today
mhm
does that look like our house John
dream on
there's white on the card
these are very old houses John
very very old
have you nearly finished
no
takes a long time for you to eat your ice
mhm
oh it's a bit of your cornflake
there's some there
perhaps it's gone home
it looks a bit water logged
swimming in your cereals
we seem to have lost all your bugs John
where are all your plastic bugs that Daddy bought you
have you posted them
yeah
where have you posted them
oh behind the radiator
in your bed
oh that's okay
we can get those easy enough
in your bed
you haven't seen Mummy's bed
Mummy was painting it yesterday
it's really good
www
and Nicole was helping
all while you were asleep
pardon
I hope we have a nice quiet day
this'll be great
oh
finished it finally
a
when we went to the forest those were very nice ice
you had a red one but it wasn't strawberry was it
it was wild cherry
Daddy had the same
no
don't bite it
no
well it's Anna's isn't it
not yours
that forest would be very muddy today wouldn't it
all this wet
you'd need your Wellington boots
are your Wellington boots a bit small for you
is that why you don't like them
hmm
it hurts your foot
maybe your foot is too big
yeah
they wouldn't hurt if the welly boot was too big
maybe we have_to buy some more
now where do we buy welly boots from then
do we buy them from Tesco's
no
do we buy them from B_Q
do we buy them from a shoe shop
are you sure
what kind of a shop
a welly boot shop
in Manchester maybe
you're enjoying that
www
we'll have_to wash it
perhaps you could wash it in the sink just before Anna goes home
goes off to work
mhm
oh
hello
we don't often have days like this do we when we sit down
they're very nice
perhaps we could read your new books later
there's one about going to the zoo
Granny sent one this week didn't she
about Dogger
do you remember that one
that's a lovely book
about Dogger who got lost
and a little boy found him at a jumble sale
had to buy him back before somebody else bought him
what other books has Granny sent recently
Rosie's babys
and what happens at the very end of that book
and Rosie says me
right
don't really bite it
is it still there
what's it doing
yes
that's a surprise
is he moving
while it's lying down
is it very still
mhm
www
oh
let go John
are you a dog again
John
let go
let go
look
other people would like to play with this as_well
open your mouth
John
John
hey hey hey
John
you're so strong
let go of it
you broke the midwife's stethoscope last time she came didn't you
you bit through the cable
www
John
come on otherwise we'll have_to replace these things if you break them
John
the more I insist the more you'll do it isn't it
it's right
how about if you let Mummy have it now
it's gone
it's gone back in the box now
what else is in the bag John
what else can you find in the bag
that's the box
not the bag
then what happened
