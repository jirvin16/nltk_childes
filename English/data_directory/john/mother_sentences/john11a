here we are
here's one
you've got it in your hand poppet
does it fit in
see if it fits in
yeah
well you've got your hand in the way
you want a blue one do you
I don't know if that's possible
we've only got red cardboard or yellow
oh this one
do you want this one as a blue one
yeah okay
here you are
here's a blue one
it's a bit too big for your pot though
hmm
does it not fit in
no
oh good
another one
oh there's a yellow one with cornflakes on it
you want another one
you don't want it
okay well put it over here
a new one first
another one with cornflakes on
and oh this one's got a raisin on it
one more
this one's got some numbers on
is that too big
let me make it smaller
here you are
some more
what color's that one
mhm

or is that enough
more
how many have you got now John

oh now that should fit now
some more
shall we have a different shape one now
and another one
can you take that one off
it's a square or a diamond
depends which way you look at it
oh

five and
six more shapes left
want any more shapes or shall we just play with these
these
these are the same John
these are the circles
is this one the same
yes
this one's a square though
look this is different
try again
okay
try that one
yes
all fitted on top of each_other
that's a circle
mhm

can I have a look
put it in the pot so you know where it is
oh that one needs trimming perhaps does it
shall I trim that one
getting smaller and smaller these
mhm
flip
last one
right
all_gone
have we got a lid for that
have we got a lid for this
no I don't think we have in here have we
I think it's upstairs somewhere
unless you've looked for it in here
it could be in here
oh there's somewhere else you can put your shapes
or this one
two things you can put them in
yeah
turn them into money
good
this one's got a raisin on
shall we count them as we put them in that
one
two
three
oh
is that it
all_gone
oh well
is that your money
you'd better keep it safe now then
we could make you a credit card John
here we are
shall we have one of these to put in your wallet
yeah
there we are
a cornflake credit card
you could put it in one of these
this window
and then you can see the cornflakes look through the window
your cornflakes are in there now
do you want another credit card
the real things are as easy to get hold of John but really difficult to get rid of
there we are
there's a red one
oh look
can we join them together like a jigsaw
look
look there's the lady's head
and there's the lady's body and arms
we could use
there's some more pockets in here John
you could put them somewhere else
in this one
oh look
there's in here
a little pocket here
and a little pocket there
okay
mhm
where's the hole
oh there it is
does that tickle you
does it tickle you under your hair
when you were a baby you used to squish this right against your face and leave little dots on your cheek
yes
just like that
okay
we should go shopping with all this then
with all the money and the credit cards
shall we go shopping
no
okay
oh is it too big
perhaps I've made it too big
oh look
I think you need to push it in a bit more
very good
are you going to trust me with your money
thank_you
thank_you
can I put it in here now John
a big zip here
do you want this one
this is a square
are there
oh I suppose they're more like rectangle aren't they
where is the square
it is behind you actually John
yes
here it is
very good
good
all done
well you can put them in the other purse perhaps
two credit cards
okay
put them in there then
okay right
that's it
now what
what do you want to do now
okay
are you going to put it back
are you going to put it back in the box
you look like an old man
www
let me show you something
let me show you something
if you turn these upside down look
they all look the same
they're all the same color
what color are they now
what color is this
yes good snap
they are the same
very good
they're all grey and they're all circles
but if you turn the upside down they're all different
that's funny isn't it
these are similar but they're not the same
they're still different
oh a bit of red
that's got a bit of yellow and that's got a bit of blue
they've all got cornflakes on them
this one's got raisins
that one's got a bit of milk on it
whoops
