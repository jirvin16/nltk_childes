wrapped
up
in
a
towel
and
who
did
you
fetch
to
watch
the

with
you
yeah
the
fireworks
were
red
who
did
you
fetch
from
your
bed
to
watch
the
fireworks
it
was
dolly
was
not
it
John
where
are
all
your
tool
things
there
seem
to
be
hardly
any
in
here
now
all
scattered
around
the
house
there
is
one
by
the
door
there
is
a
little
nut
there
a
screw
fetch
that
one
no
John
behind
the
door
here
behind
the
door
just
here
mhm
we
are
a
bit
short
of

though
be
not
we
can
you
put
the
bolt
on

mhm
upside
down
very
good
John
shall
we
tighten
it
John
shall
we
tighten
it
with
the
spanner
now
no
it
is
not
a
monkey
wrench
spanner
well
it
is
like
a
monkey
wrench
in
your
book
but
it
is
not
quite
this
is
a
spanner
I
wonder
if
this
fits
does
this
fit
on
here
it
does
it
fits
if
it
is
really
too
tight
we
can
use
the
end
of
the
spanner
for
getting
it
undone
do
you
want
to
do
it
okay
we
will
put
it
back
then
well
maybe
we
have_to
make
this
smaller
can
you
twist
this
to
make
it
smaller

think

is
supposed
to
fit
