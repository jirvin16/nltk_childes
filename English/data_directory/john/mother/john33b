good
what
other
verses
did
we
sing
last

about
the
wipers
what
about
the
Daddys
on
the
bus
knock
knock

yeah
oh
that
is
right

right
well
it
is
a
way
of
doing
it
there
is
not
a
right
way

another
one
on
the
other
bit

what
about

chimney
where
does
that
go

by
your
foot
your
leg
John

you
going
to
put
this
oh
you
could
put
the
brick
there
yeah
that
is
a
good
train
John
that
looks
a
bit
more
modern
perhaps
if
you
put
this
one
instead
of
these
two
possibly
well
yeah
mhm
is
your
train
going
to
pull
a
carriage
sounds
very
quiet
to
me
dolly
pardon

like
that
water
good

seems
that
you
do
you
are
very
thirsty
where

not
it
does
not
look
too
different
from
me
what
is
the
instrument
yeah
it
is
a
very
old
flute
that
one
well
looks
a
bit
like
Mummy
but
it
is
not
that
other
flute
a
lady
called
Catherine
no
it
is
not
Mummy
mhm

is
the
lady
again
you
think
it
is
a
man
oh

like
it
put
it
back
where
would
you
like
to
put
it
this
end
or
this
end
this
end
okay
let
us
make
a
space
there
oh

I
think
there
are
a
couple
missing
does
that
look
right
John
it
is
my
what
it
is
my
tea
is
it
on
a
saucer
plate
can
I
keep
it
for
later
yes
I
know
how
to
eat
John
I
will
save
it
for
when
my
tea's
cool
enough
to
drink
whoops
is
that
one
coming
out
as_well
it
is
going
to
be
fixed
no
we
are
actually
going
to
take
the
fire
out
very
soon
because
we
do
not
use
it
do
we
what
else
is
in
the
bag
John
as_if
you
did
not
know
John
John
what
else
can
you
find
in
the
bag

it
is
the
sausage
where

about
tipping
the
things

says
salmon
on
the
outside

the
food
things

somebody
else's
house

had
a
good
chew
on
it

not
you
over

is
which
which
has
the
egg
and
which
has
the
tomato
