nor that pot there
that's not shopping is it
don't throw it
don't throw it Becky
you don't throw things like that
that'll break it
I think it's gone actually Becky
no
I think it's gone
it's been out for a long time
it's corn
that it's like this look
only it comes in a tin
all the bits are taken off and it's in a tin
see all those little nibblie bits
you take them off and put them in a tin
no
that willn't fit in the tin
yeah
well
that's how you eat it
when you eat this you see these little bits here
you see these little squares
well
each one is a little bit of corn
and when they all come off they go in a pile like in the picture
and then you you're left with just a core to this
just a middle bit
which gets thrown away then
and all the corn goes in the tin
yeah
don't
hmm
oh good
is it in your tummy now then
oh right
oh yes
I can see it
yes
well
I don't want it if you've eaten it all do I
dog food
that's not nice
there's some dog food here
and here's some cat
it's not loads of dogs
there's one dog
is there one or two
two dogs aren't there
I think
it's a bit deceptive actually
can I just have a look
yeah
there's two dogs aren't there
there's one there
and one there
so it just looks like loads because you're turning it round
that's baked beans
you've got a dog
well
you'll need some dog food then willn't you
what's that
soup
it's soup
tomato soup
that's corn
it's not animal food Becky
I don't think cats will eat corn
it is
yes
alright
but very quick
and just pretend
okay
don't get cat on that Becky
don't get cat on it
go on
put put some on the dish
good girl
Sukie will eat that now when he comes in willn't he

it's not very warm with the door open
thank_you
alright
I'm alright
aren't you
no
I'm not very warm either
what dog are you Becky
are you
what a surprise
don't think it'll fit in there
well
they go in because they're a little bit smaller than the cat tin
can you see how they're a little bit smaller
so they fit in don't they
mhm
but the cat tin willn't fit in will it
well
no
that willn't fit in either
no
I don't think that will fit in
it's too big
they are smaller
it's spaghetti
oh no
don't don't force it in
this one fits in I think
it is
yes
mummie's clever isn't she
mummie's clever
no

no
that one is
yes
willn't go in that end
I don't know Becky
