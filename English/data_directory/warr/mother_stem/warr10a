we
could
make
Henry
s
tunnel
right
let
us
get
some
brick
out
to
make
Henry
s
tunnel
I
think
we
I
think
we
be
make
Henry
s
tunnel
pet
here
be
Henry
s
tunnel
the
problem
be
you
see
we
have
not
get
enough
track
to
do
two
two
track
so
this
train
s
go
to
get
stick
in
Henry
s
tunnel
it
go
round
he
will
get
into
Henry
s
tunnel
and
he
can
not
come

it
can
never
mind
we
can
make
that
a
decoration
for
the
top
of

could
pretend
it
be
a
train
with
a
snowplow
on
the
front
that
look
like
a
snowplow
do
not
it
oh
that
