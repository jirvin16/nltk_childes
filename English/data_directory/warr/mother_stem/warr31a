something
strange
about
you
be
that
what
it
be
you
be
a
elephant
and
I
always
think
you
be
a

a
level
cross
be
it
there
be
some
vehicle
wait
at
the
level
cross
wrong
vehicle
wait
which
vehicle
should
it
be
no
they
do
not
no

do
not
come
on
road
do
they
I
do
not
think
tram
do
sometimes
but
train
do
not
and
Henry
be
definite
a
train
he
be
not
a
tram
yes
tram
do
but
train
do
not
train
stay
on
rail
no
because
the
problem
be
you
be
not
go
to
listen
to
reason
be
you
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
we
see
a
helicopter
this
morning
do
not
we
be
the
helicopter
in
here
be
its
rotor
in
there
because
they
be
kick
about
in
your

may
be
somewhere
miss
maybe
I
vacuum

for
the
window
of
our
last

this
be
the
key
