I think that goes there
can you see a piece with some number on
to go here
just moved it
that's it
look
now he goes he goes near the back
can you see a piece
where does that piece go
no
it's the blue flashing light
there's another broken blue light there
do you think those pieces go together
if you put those pieces together will it mend the blue light
hooray
yeah
that goes right at the back
this goes somewhere over here
that goes in there
a firefighter on the phone and a firefighter driving
oh look
there's a broken helmet there with no face underneath it
can you mend it by putting that piece in
no
that goes there
I think that piece goes here
look
there's a man's leg with a bit taken out_of it and there's a piece of leg
that's it
now there's the man's body that goes on the legs
can you fit the man's body onto his legs
that's it
and you've mended the wheel as_well
because there was a piece taken out_of the wheel
now can you mend this sliding door here
the bit that slides down and covers the hose
the top bit's missing
can you mend it
hooray
and you've mended his helmet look
now we've got two pieces left
we've got that piece and that piece
which one goes where
try it the other way round
turn it round
excuse you
that's it
now where does this piece go
that's the hat but where where's the face to go under the hat
that's it
brilliant
finished
how many firefighters are there
that's very good except you counted one of them twice
how many blue lights
it is isn't it
and what's this
do you know what this is
that's a light
a very strong light
a floodlight in fact
and when they switch that on so if they have_to go to a fire in the dark they can see what's going on when they've stopped the fire
and they can see where all the hoses are
and they can see how where to put the key in to unlock these sliding doors
so they can see what they're doing
where are you going
what on earth are you doing wild boy
I think you ought_to calm down
don't you
what have you got
what have you just picked up
chips

you're good at jigsaws aren't you
shall we get out your kitten and puppy jigsaws
do you want to break that one up
pull that one apart and put it in the box then we can get out your kitten and puppy jigsaws
the one that you ate yesterday
that's it
it's much easier breaking them up isn't it
than putting them together
just put the lid on and we'll get out your kitten and puppy shall we
which are up near the top so you couldn't get them
whoops
so you couldn't get them yesterday
you'd been eating them
look
who ate it
yeah
silly boy
don't do it again mate
terrible child
right
I've got three jigsaws all muddled up here
look
there's a hole in the cat's face
I wonder why
poor cat
right
let's sort out which jigsaw goes where
don't don't eat it
they'll go straight back if you eat them
there
that's one
right
that's another one
let's put this one together
where's the cat's body
to go next_to its head
where's the cat's body
there it is
now where do these pieces go
Warren
these three pieces
where do they go
no
no
that doesn't fit
we need a bit of the cat's ear there don't we
can you see a piece with a little bit of the cat's ear on right at the bottom
there it is
and what goes here
it's the dog's face isn't it
dog's head goes here so which piece is it
yeah
that's it
and we've got two gaps
three gaps
one here and one here and one here
that's not very good is it
terrible child
shall we take that one apart and make it again
one two three four five six pieces
can Warren put it together
we'll leave this one
we'll do this one first
how does it fit together
no
it doesn't go there
no
it doesn't go there
you need a piece with green at the bottom to go here
you need a piece with green on
I think it's the dog's legs
and the dog's body
look
pardon
what with your bottom
smelly boy
why are you lying down
are you tired
oh dear
that one goes in the middle at the top
in the middle
that's right
in the middle
that bit goes on the right
and that bit goes on the left
that's it
that one goes on the right
line it up carefully
that's it
and that bit goes on the left
hooray
shall we do the other one now
let's do this one
tissue
why do you want a tissue
you haven't got a tissue in your pocket
you haven't got one
would you like a tissue
would you like a tissue in your pocket
there isn't one in there
your pockets are empty
no
it's not a nappie
that's a white bit on the cat's chest
cats don't wear nappies
because cats are house trained unlike boys
you're not house trained are you
where are all the other pieces for your jigsaw
that's it
you finish off her eyes
that's it
look at that chewed one
let's turn the pieces this way up so we can see the picture on them

move your fingers
move your fingers
well you did such a good job of getting him then Mummy shall Mummy help
Warren
you did nearly get him out last time
shall Mummy get him now
because I felt sorry for you because you very nearly got it
it's just that your little fingers pushed instead of pulled
well you'll have_to get him out all by yourself
move your hand because I'm going to drop the fire
do you know you're a great festering you
right
now pull it
Warren
fingers out
fingers out again
look
pull it
not push
you put your hands on top of it like that and then pull it towards you
okay
Warren
listen
listen and learn
if you put your finger on top of it and pull it like that it will come out
okay
put your fingers on top and pull
that's it
sorry pet

well hold it further down here
hold it here
that's it
you remembered how to get it that time didn't you
you've just pushed it back in
there we go
no
you need to bring it closer to the front
be careful how you push it because you might just push it further away
you did didn't you
you left it on the floor and trod on it
that's what happens when things are left on the floor and people tread on them
they get broken
are you going to mix some cement
well why don't you put the jigsaw pieces in and turn them round
there you go
is that another one
well spotted
