are you
right
are you making the edge
what're you making now
the edge of what
an edge and a tower
okay
that's fine
oh yes
the blue one's stuck to the green one isn't it
yeah
two green ones together
where's that piece going to go
where's the red bit going
are you turning his head
what's the man doing on the arch
do you want the other men
shall Mummy help you to look
yes there are
there are two men somewhere
oh I thought that was a man but it's a baby tiger
don't know where these men are Warren
a
here's one
here's one
I'm looking for the other one
I'm finding all sorts of things Warren but not not the other man
we've not seen these before have we Warren
the sheep and the chickens
the cow and the calf
I think the other man has got a green base hasn't it
thank_you
oh
that's a new one
look
oh Warren
what's this
choo
shall we put the truck on the train
no
it's not Henry
because Henry's green
okay
fine
well I don't know where the other man is Warren
now these look like something from a horror film
he's not there
the other man I don't think is in here
I think the other man might be having a little holiday somewhere
somewhere nice and warm perhaps
just feel how cold the doll is
okay
I think that man's gone somewhere nice and warm
yeah just two men
well there's a man here but this man's got legs
you see
because he's the train driver
you see
and he sits in the train
what is it
what is it
mhm
oh I think it probably is stuck on the bricks
yes
that's it
it's like a sun isn't it
shall we put the baby tiger on the sun
okay yes
that one'll go on there I think
let's just see
there we go
a whale on the sun
is that too big
we could have a penguin on the sun
perhaps um
the baby whale on the funnel maybe
maybe not
is that too big
yes
I don't think it'll fit on
I can balance it on
a bit hot don't you think
choo
reversing
look
what's this at the front here
do you know what it is
it's a cow catcher
it's like what Toby_the_Tram_Engine has
so_that things can't get stuck under his wheels at the front
things like cows
Warren
just look at your tower
yeah
you knocked that down
you sat on it my love and it fell down
yeah
you mind what you do with your bottom
there you go
coupling it up
the cow catcher looks a bit like the snowplow that Thomas had didn't it in the story about the village getting cut off
why do you want to see her tummy
her trousers
mind you
I suppose cousin Tom has got long hair
so you might think it was a man
but Tom doesn't have bows in his hair does he
well undo the velcro at the back
and you take the blouse off
take the other arm out
that's it
oh poor dolly
she's got no clothes on
a bare doll
right
let's help
if you do that
shall we put her pants on
is that a good idea
right
now what do we have_to do
we have_to thread her feet in don't we
thread them in
thread the left foot and the right foot
oh
she's standing on her head
there we go
she's got
oh her tummy's gone hasn't it
now we're putting her dress on
and we thread her arms through the arm holes
okay
right arm through there
can you thread her left arm
can you thread the left arm
through there
oh
let's fasten her dress
oh nice dolly
that's a pretty dress isn't it
I think this goes on with this dress
shall we put her fancy collar on
I don't know
what is it doing on the floor
oh dear
no
you didn't bang it with your bottom that time
I think it just fell over
oh look
look at these extra animals
there's even a goat
do you know a song about a sheep
what color is the sheep in the song
that is a very tall tower
look
oh no
that's it
what a tall tower
where's that man now
where is he
yeah
one man high up
one man low down
yeah
are you making another tall tower
I think the tiger's too big to go on that little tower
the baby tiger would fit
choo
here's the baby tiger
on the sun
here we go
what's the elephant doing
mhm
I hope it's not going to crash
because that would hurt the elephant and the baby tiger
and the driver
it is isn't it
oh well
never mind
I'm sure it'll find a way out somehow
it's driving over a cow
are you taking elephant out or just uncoupling the the truck
couple them back together
it is
the cow catcher's not worked very well has it
I suppose it's caught the cow and knocked the cow over
oh no
it's got the baby horse
the bulls the bulls are lying down as_well
here are two bulls
oh you want them
why
are they sleeping
and there's the Mummy horse
she's lying down
oh poor baby horse
oh no oh no
it's run away
and the Mummy horse is running after it
picking the baby horse up and she's going to run off with him
into the box where it'll be safe
but is it safe
or is Warren going to get them out
oh no
he's getting them out
can't remember how she did it
let's lie the baby horse down again
I think I just did that
that was it
whoops
clear away
we've heard the
I think the I think the points must have been stuck and he's gone off into a siding
there's a nice clear track here
through Henry's tunnel
well what
if you take the elephant out you can put the tiger in the truck
lift the elephant out
lift him out
put the tiger in instead
then you've got the Mummy tiger in the trailer
and you've got the baby on the sun
will the tiger fit in
maybe not
his tail's too long
oh no
well it'll stand in it loose
no
you can't fix her in because the tail sticks out
this isn't designed for tigers
it's designed for elephants or horses
no
just leave her like that
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
stuck in the tunnel
peep
oh no
you've run over the bull now
and the other bull
no
that's not
I don't know where the baby cow's gone
that's the horse and the baby horse
going over the cow now
oh dear
oh no
the tiger's out
she's back again
that cow was stuck
oh
tiger's out again
oh yes
oh
you've broken Anna's toy
oh
do you think Anna'll cry
better put it back together again quickly hadn't you before she starts to cry
no
I think it goes that way round actually
because you've mended it now
oh
shall I get the tissue box to pass to Anna
a that's better isn't it
does it all come apart
oh yes
look
you can take it all apart
put it back on quick quick
look
it's a train without a driver
oh no
it's a runway train
it's a runaway train
running away because there's noone to drive it
oh no oh no
good job it's coming to a hill and it's slowing down
quick
the driver can jump back on
it's not running away any more
hey
I tell you what
if we put the baby tiger inside the baby tiger can drive the train
is the man going to drive it again
we should really call it a driver then it could be a man or a woman couldn't it
baby tiger back on top
what's that
what color is it
what color's this elephant
what color is it
is it a blue elephant
is it a yellow elephant
is the baby tiger keeping an eye on the elephant to make sure it doesn't escape
to make sure it doesn't run away
that's a very bumpy line isn't it
might get derailed
okay
Warren push the trailer on while Mummy holds the coach the truck
no
the other way other end
you got it right the first time
what was that funny noise
is that your jumper
under Warren's bridge
bridge
and I always thought you kept orange juice and beer in a fridge but there we are
trains stay in fridges do they
do trains go in fridges
where are those two men going
where are they going on the train
Warren
look at it
is it the right way up
the bit of tower in your hand
you were putting it on the wrong way up weren't you
and is the train staying under the bridge
it's getting a bit cold in here
have_to keep moving about to try to keep warm
in fact it's so cold the penguins have come
they think it's the Antarctic
they're going to huddle together while the eggs hatch out
okay
the man's on it
oh he's cold
quick
get the other man on so they can come out_of the fridge
choo
oh they're warming up now
oh no
the funnel and the dome's off
that's the dome
that's the funnel where the smoke and steam comes out
I think
that's the light
now you see that's interesting because Thomas and Henry don't have lights up there do they
they have lights down here
no
the buffers
no
the dome the light goes at the front like that
because the light comes out so it can see where it's going on the track at night when it's dark
that's a bumpy track
where's it taking the animals
and the men
where's it going
it is stuck isn't it
what are we going to do
shall we get the panda to come and give it a push from behind
Warren pull
panda push
oh no
one truck's derailed
and uncoupled
oh no oh no
let's put it back together again
quick quick quick quick quick
panda push
the panda in his car is pushing
