move them onto the bottom then you can tip it
lift the red bit
that's it
how many blocks are there in here
how many blocks
what's that one
elephant
that's right
and what's this

can you put the plane back in the toddle truck
let's have a look at all the pictures shall we
all these pictures
that's a number ten
number ten
sometimes you can count can't you
two three
that's right
oh dear
what's happened
oh
fell out didn't they
that's because you lifted the yellow bit and not the red bit
that's it
the red bit
going going going going going going
no they're not
one in
one out
I think there's only one more to go in now
where's the other brick
where's the last brick
all yeah
they're all in
I don't think there are any more
shall we see because we know how many there should be don't we
does that look right
where's the plane
can you see the plane
where is it
good
where's the elephant
can you spot it
no that's a
what's that
yeah that's not an elephant
what's that
that's right
um what's that
mhm
it's a red car
a red plane
and a red boat
they're all red aren't they
that's a nice nice
shall we find some more bricks for you to put in your digger
shall we try and find some more
here's some little bricks
how about you try those in the digger
or are they too small
I think they go in here quite well
in fact
you can probably scoop them up nicely and fit lots in
yeah I think you can fit lots in there
I wonder if
can you fit them all in
I don't think you can
oh dear yeah
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that's probably enough though isn't it
crash
what
is that Granddad's
oh it's Nana's
don't bite it
you'll hurt your teeth
willn't willn't willn't
hurt your teeth when you bite wood
we could always build something with this
what's yours
is that yours
this is Nana's
you told me
whose is this
that's Nana's as_well is it
okay
whose is that
that's Granddad's
whose is this
that was very nice of her
are you sure that's Warren's
or is it Daddy's
Mummy's
oh thank_you
can I have my green brick then
thank_you
there we go
Mummy's put her brick on
oh dear
oh
what's happened to that tower
why doesn't Warren build it this time
you build a tower
do you have_to crawl all over me child
let's put your slipper back on
do you want Mummy to help
is that because I'm an expert at building towers
one
three
three
four
five
good except you've knocked them all down
six
seven
slid off
I don't think that's very successful now
so what number was that
was that eight
oh nine was it
and so what's that
ten
oh dear
I don't think any more  fit on that
I think they'll all fall off
slide down there
and if I put that on there
what'll happen
let's build another
shall we build it on here then it's higher up to start with isn't it
shall we put that one there
I think this tower'll get very tall somehow
thank_you
can I put mine on now
right let's start again
oh sorry sorry sorry
oh thank_you sweetheart
that's very kind of you to give me one brick
is that Granddad's
where is Granddad
is he gone
where's he gone
in there car
where did Granddad go in the car
pardon
in bed
yes he was in bed last time you saw him wasn't he
why was Granddad in bed
why was Granddad in bed
can you remember
it was your new word last week
see who can build the tallest tower shall we
Warren build a tower
Mummy's building a tower look
don't you wreck it
right
going going going going going going
oh oh
Warren
why don't you build a tower with it
yeah
there's no need to throw them if you don't want to use them
oh
it is off isn't it
Warren put it on
I think you're putting it on upside down and back to front sweetheart
you thread your foot in like that
oh you've got the idea haven't you
you've got your toes in
let's thread the rest of your foot
thread thread
there you go
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
is your heel out
oh dear
they're too big really aren't they
for your dainty feet
you're very good at building towers aren't you
are you going to be an architect when you're grown up
or are you going to be like Fred knocking things down
okay you build it then if it's yours
no don't
don't bash them with your foot
bashing with your foot Warren is called kicking
yeah
and kicking isn't nice
so don't bash with your feet please
oh yes
you're moving it about aren't you
what's that
what color
excellent
always a safe bet asking the color of something that's red
shall we put a yellow one on the top
shall I put you on the top
then can we throw you across the room
was that not a good idea
what's gone
no don't kick it
that's right
you can bash with your hands but not with your feet
well you build another tower then you can bash it down can't you
yeah go on then
bash it
hey
of course
it's more exciting if you have a big tower I think to bash it
you build a really tall tower
find some more bricks and build a tall tower
then bash it
who's that
why don't you count
look there's some spots here
you could count them
more than two spots
how many are there
one two three four five spots
well not bad
how many spots on there
yeah there are three
one two three spots
and a ship
there's all sorts of things on these bricks aren't there
there's two big bits of picture
there's a man's legs with his feet at the bottom
there's a ship
with a bit of track and some wheels
some steam
number three
little hole
and there's some dots
look there's a funny shaped hole on that one
and on that one
what's that shape like
well I don't think it looks like Granddad
on balance
that looks more like Granddad
except he doesn't usually wear a top hat
that's the Fat_Controller
yes
shall make the picture up so you can see Thomas on it
Thomas yeah
Thomas_the_Tank
Thomas_the_Tank
you sing the train song
why don't you sing the bat song
twinkle twinkle little
how I wonder what you're at
up above the world so
like a tea train in the sky
twinkle twinkle little
bat how I wonder what you're at
look
there's Thomas
who's that
it's the Fat_Controller isn't it
yes
there's a light
there's a porter with a suitcase and somebody coming out
and there's Annie or is it Clarabell
right let's tip it out carefully
oh look
who've we got here
no I don't think it's Thomas
I think that's Gordon and that's Henry
and what's that
it does look like a parrot actually
it's got like a parrotty beak
and there's the there's the guard waving
oh dear
and what who's that
and who's that
a boy and a girl
again
which again
oh okay
just a sec
let's put the picture back together
put the box over it
I don't know if I can actually pick it up
I don't think I can
let's have a go shall we
you have great faith in me Warren
yes
aren't I clever
am I a clever Mummy
who's that
that's Annie
who's that
yeah that's Thomas
can you see the steam coming out_of his um chimney
what's all_gone
who's that
he's the Fat_Controller
what's that
mhm
shall we mix up the picture
shall we tip it out
Warren tip it out
are you making the picture now
that's a nice picture
I don't know where Thomas's face is
where's Thomas's face
you've got
whose faces have you got here
you've got Gordon and Henry's face
where's Thomas's face
can't see it
it must be somewhere
where is it
that's Clarabell
that's Annie
where's Thomas's face
where
that's not Thomas's face
oh he's probably on one of these isn't he
on one of these on here
there he is
there's Thomas
what again
Thomas again right
well who else is on the picture with Thomas
yeah the Controller the Fat_Controller is
if we can find
where's the Fat_Controller
that one's on as_well because that's the porter with his baggage
where's the Fat can you see the Fat_Controller
look
look at the bricks
where's the Fat_Controller
you put it in there
put it there
good boy
right
what else was on the picture
was the bird on the picture
I don't think he was was he
I think that was on
do you want the picture or not sweetheart
oh that's a nice picture isn't it
shall we put these just anywhere we like then
it makes it much easier
yeah let's stick them in
let's have a random picture
you put the last two in then
no put the picture bit at the top
not a hole
well that looks incredibly strange doesn't it
these three are right aren't they
those three are right
you can't have that looking like that
so where's Thomas's face
gone
where is he
yes
he's in the wrong place
yes it is the Fat_Controller
this is like one of those fiendish puzzles isn't it Warren
when you spend hours moving bricks around
pictures around trying to get the
what's gone
no he's there
shall we put that one there
push it up into that space
then we can see that it's the wrong thing at the top
must be that one
what's in there
that's the top of the carriage so_that must go up here
can you see the brown bit at the bottom
that one goes there
and there's the track
just this piece and then that goes in
is that right
is that one right
does that look right Warren
I don't think it does
that's right
yeah what've you done
no the picture's gone now
yeah Warren make the picture this time
