that's right
there shouldn't be a monkey in there should there because monkeys don't drive trains
yeah well women can drive trains as_well
what're you doing
never mind
it goes back on
what's coming
there's another truck behind you Warren
look behind you
look right behind you
because there's the other truck there
no
behind you
next_to the chair
there we go
well the thing is the monkey doesn't sit on things like that
he kind of stands on it
if you move his arms up a little bit
one
the other one
now you stand his feet on here
his feet on here
like that
because I don't think he sits down on things
he might sit on the funnel
a bit of a hot seat I think you'd call it
oh
not a good fit
shall we stand him on here again or on the cab roof
he normally stands up rather than sits down
that's the funnel
yeah
that's going to be a very tall truck
look at all those bricks
I hope that doesn't go through a low tunnel
great Scott
there's a horse on it
I hope that horse doesn't mind heights
the ambulance is in your vehicle box
which is next_to the blue box
Warren
that's a horrible noise
is the horse all right up there
he's not scared is he
Warren
Warren
is the horse all right up there
he's not scared
because you know how Jolly_tall gets scared when he goes up high doesn't he
I'm glad the horse is okay
yeah
making a fence here
oh good
that's a rather strange place for a bit of fencing but never mind
we need the gates don't we
if I put that there then we can have the gate there
right
let's build the fence a bit higher
put a cow in there
but I might have wanted that field for horses or chickens
where are the chickens
I'd like some chickens in my field please
can you find me some chickens
now what's happened here
why are these cows sticking together
that's it
oh yes
there
is that wall high enough round the field
oh here's a cow coming in
moo
close the gate so they can't run away
oh no
there's a savage tiger creeping up
and the savage tiger's going to climb over the wall
grr
I don't think we'd want to close the tiger in really but never mind
along comes super pig
flys in
sits on the tiger's back and the tiger turns into a tame animal and goes to sleep
there's super pig
are they all asleep now
we haven't really got anything to use as a blanket unless unless we use the doll's dress or blouse
could do
we could line them all up
shall we cover them up
tuck them up under the blanket
there we go
have they woken up now
are they waking up
oh no
are they escaping
shall the panda try and round them up
back tiger
back
oh no
the tiger's tangled up
get in there tiger
come on cow
he's looking over making sure they don't try to escape again
there we are
who is
oh poor panda
you give him a cuddle then
make him feel better
no
I don't think the car would fit into the field sweet
gate shut
animals can't escape
except for the tiger who can jump very high
oh no
the bull's out
going on the rampage
is the pig sleeping
well the cow and the bull might fit in this way
if we pop the bull in next_to the cow like this
quick
get the gate on
stop that tiger from escaping
where's the car going to go if it can't go in the field
where've they been in the car
Malta
that was a long drive
yeah
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
even if it knocked the gate down it couldn't fit in because its wheels are too wide
unless it climbed over the top of the wall
I don't I don't think it can
I didn't realize that was an ambulance
I thought it was an ordinary car
or is it because it's the panda's car
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
the car's too wide
oh no
it's not going to drive over the wall is it
but there's no driver
no
it hasn't got a driver in
who's going to drive it
I don't know Warren
we're both yawning
we need early nights tonight
who might put Warren to bed tonight
yeah
would you like Paul to bath you and put you to bed
oh
would you like Tom to
Sue
Mummy
well those are the only people that can bath you and put you to bed tonight because Daddy's going away
so I think it'd be nice if Paul did
Paul came and saw you the other night didn't he
when you'd just gone you were just having your story
they are aren't they
that lion that tiger's going to run away very fast
where is it
where's the tiger gone
grr
running away
grr
he's going to bite your nose
oh
shall it kiss your nose
mm
lick your cheek
lick lick lick
oh no
you've got a tiger on your knee
oh
no
you haven't
you've knocked it off
oh he's sleeping on your knee
oh that's nice
he's a nice stripy tiger isn't he
mhm
don't move about too much if you're sleeping
oh he's awake
I don't think that
oh
I think the car's wedged now
don't you
a wedged car
oh yes
thing is Warren
that car cheated
it flew
cars don't normally fly
cars don't fly
if the car's in the field where are all the animals going to go
no space for them really is there
I think that car ought_to come out and let the animals in
that's better
because fields are for animals
not for cars
those poor animals
got no field
sounds a good idea
oh that's nice
are you having a rest
you are having a rest aren't you
can they creep past the car into the bit of field
oh the car's coming out
I think these animals are going to go scampering in very fast
and shut the gate so the car can't come in
right
the tiger's going to come and frighten the car away
grr
a
brumm
but the car is sneaky
going to come creeping back and try and sneak in over the wall here
but the tiger's noticed and it's going to come and frighten it away again
grr
a
Warren
do you need your pottie
Warren
stand up
are you sure
and you don't need anything else
oh
oh yes
yes
you must always shut gates when you've been through them mustn't you
to stop creatures from escaping
oh that was a big jump wasn't it
that gate is open and shut an awful lot isn't it
well who's going to join the cow and the bull and the baby horse and the pig
that's another bull
a black bull
oh yes
no
it's a brown and white bull
I think
well I don't think you need to tip it all out
I don't think that's a good idea
come here
Warren
just come here
do you need a poo
are you sure
mhm
oh where are all those bricks
oh they're hidden underneath the box
oh yes
oh here's here's the Mummy
is baby tiger going to have a ride on his Mummy's back
baby tiger will fit on you know
there
like that
looks a bit funny though doesn't it
the giraffe's got into the field
that's it
what happens if you leave the gate open
creatures can get in or out can't they
who's going in there
oh
are they all running away
yeah
noone in there
what's coming in
what's coming in
tram
good job it's got a cow
it can push its way through all those bricks
