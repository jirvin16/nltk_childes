thank_you Warren
she can sit and watch you play now
oh yes
oh yeah
oh no
it's not got the cab on it either has it

I can see some of it peeping out
well it's red
with a yellow roof
look at the panda's car
take it out
yeah
it was hidden wasn't it
it was hiding under that car
I don't know
you look for him
mhm
the man's a bit small
there's a problem with that man driving like that Warren
he can't see where he's going
oh yes
shall we put them on
do you want to thread her legs in
I see you're about as accurate putting her pants on as you are putting your own on
right
there's one leg hole
right
thread the other leg through the other hole
no
we don't want two through the same hole Warren
you do that with your shorts sometimes don't you
end up looking like a mermaid

is that better now she's got her pants on
there we go
have you found that panda yet
oh yes
it's just like your giraffe
well it's not a good idea to get yours out is it because it might get mixed up
that's a good noise
you obviously don't think so
but you've still not found that panda yet have you
I don't know
two men in a train
there should be some more men shouldn't there in here somewhere
oh look
here's a tiger like yours as_well
is that a man
thank_you
I don't know
it could go on the roof of the cab
there
they fit on nicely there don't they those three people
but she's already got a dress on
what's somewhere
there's that dress here
it's got a little fancy collar and lace
is that what you're looking for
a little blouse
well why don't you take it off
you undo it at the back
I'll hold her hair up
okay
you take it off
now is she just going to wear the trousers or is she going to wear the blouse underneath
right
let's thread her in
right
just let me do her blouse up
a blouse is like a shirt Warren
her right foot and
if that's her right foot which foot's that
no
right foot and
left foot
where's your left foot
um where is your left foot
where's your left foot
yeah

that's left ear
left foot
left leg
left hand
left arm
left ear
left eye
left nostril
I don't think it was
I think it was in the tree outside
we need to get some more nuts don't we for that bird
mind you they don't eat many nuts in summer
perhaps we'll go out this afternoon and find some nuts for the birds
shall we go shopping this afternoon
we could go to Wellington couldn't we
to buy some nuts
and there's something else we need as_well
I can't remember what it is
something else exciting like bird nuts
maybe actually if we go to Wellington we might be able to buy one of those very strong bird feeders
made of metal and wood
it'll last longer than those little bags
although there aren't many squirrels here
I've not seen any squirrels
we had to have a strong bird at home didn't at our last house didn't we
because the squirrels came and ripped those bags apart
I've not seen any squirrels here
have you
no
oh no
what can we do
get you up
oh what a heavy boy
you keep falling off
oh I can't
you're too heavy
I can't pull you up
dolly's going to help
you are too heavy
I'll just have_to leave you like that
that's a shame because you can't eat your punch if you're lying like that
can't have your ham sandwich or your spreaded cheese sandwich
oh
now why have you suddenly sat up
is it the thought of lunch
good
though how you can want lunch after several cakes I don't know
what kind of animals are they looking for
eerrgh
eerrgh
that elephant's cheeky isn't it
eerrgh
you woke up last night didn't you and cried because your elephant had fallen out_of bed
do you remember that Warren
do you remember crying and saying I want my elephant
and I came up and said your elephant's about six inches away from the edge of your bed
why can't you get him
and you said no
Mummy get him
I want my elephant
a softie Mummy got the elephant for you of course
watch it
the panda might jump in
oh no
the panda's fallen out
poor panda
well his legs because his legs are a bit stiff aren't they
do you want your nose wiping
you're disgusting
going going going going going going going going
I shall attack you with it
where's your snozzle
mhm
why is it parked up
is the driver having his lunch
or a cup of tea
oh is that to let the sunshine in
oh
it's just to let the rain in
is it because he's hot
why is the top of his cab open then
right
oh right
well it's a good idea to have your cab closed if it's raining
it's like those cars without lids that you see
they normally put their lids back on if it starts to rain
no
I don't think it did rain yesterday
did it rain when we were on holiday
yeah
it did didn't it
it rained nearly every day
and do you remember Warren
going to see all those tractors and engines in the mud
do you remember that muddy field
and you wore your wellies
and Mummy and Charlie wore sandals and they got very muddy bare feet
and we went stamping in puddles
do you remember
and the tractors had to rescue some of the vehicles because they were stuck in the mud
do you remember seeing that tractor pulling that very old fire
it was stuck in the mud
it did pull very hard and they were throwing straw everywhere weren't they so the cars wouldn't get stuck
and you listened to the music playing
you and Charlie stood and listened to the music
oh dear
are your feet stuck in the mud
is it hard work
no
pushing  not a good idea
shall I get coupled up to you then
and then we can both pull can't we
right
I'm coupled on
there we go
we're out_of the mud
we're uncoupled now
are you stuck
I am stuck
but I just coupled onto you and pulled you out_of the mud
why have you gone back in the mud
do I need to couple on or can I just push
well I'll pull because that's safer
give me your hands little stuck engine and I'll pull
buffers actually
not arms
pull poor little stuck engine
pull
pull you out_of the mud
oh no
your trousers
what shall we do with you Warren
that's a funny noise
Warren
you're mad
