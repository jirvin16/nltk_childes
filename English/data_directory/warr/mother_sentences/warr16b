oh
all right
do you want the funnel
want the funnel
and the dome
we saw some real trains didn't we Warren
with funnels and domes when we went to the museum with Katie and Charlie
do you remember
and we saw all those steam machines going with steam and smoke coming out
and pistons moving
it was exciting wasn't it
yes you did
you went in the garden
and when you went into Manchester
oh and we saw the mini trains didn't we on Sunday
you had a ride behind a mini train didn't you
you did hold on to your hats
yes
where's that monkey going to go
on the roof
shall I hold the train still while you put it on
it does fit on there somehow
I just need

no
he's wearing dungarees
like that man driving the little train was wearing
the man with the black cap on
he sat in front of Mummy on the little train
well it will get dirty but the man can always wash it can't he
because that's the best way to keep a train nice and clean to give it a good wash at the end of a day's work
I don't know
they'll be in the box somewhere
oh there's one under your bottom as_well
he was hiding
it's white actually

you're good at peeling little oranges
and Mummy's an expert at peeling big ones
thank_you sweetheart
going to eat it all up
there
I'm peeling it
throwing the peel into the bin with great accuracy
gone

what a greedy Mummy
scoffing that orange so fast
is that ice
I don't think so
I think that's fish
I think that's pink salmon
it's not ice
it's pink salmon
looks nothing like ice sweetheart
other way up
that way up
now push it in
that's it
oh

other way
Warren

I'm peeling it
where's Mummy putting the peel

I'm throwing it

is it nice
what're you doing
where are you throwing the peel

what else can you find for us to eat in there because I am rather hungry actually
do you know what those are
grapes
no
they don't have peel
I suppose they've got pips
but you spit pips
or you take
mm
that looks like a nice big juice tomato
no
don't bite
no
I've just said
Warren
don't bite
look
you've put a big ding in it now
look
you did that with your great pegs
it's all horrible and wet and slobbery
it's disgusting
that's disgusting
pump pump
what is this pumpy pumpy
look
there's a tomato on your head
oh
where did it go
oh there it is
where shall the tomato go
shall it go up the jumper
shall it go down the trousers
shall it go in the sock
where the seal normally goes
look Warren
you've got a tomato in your sock
makes a change from a seal or a baby baby tiger
that's what normally goes in your sock
yes
oh no
that tomato's stuck
let's take your sock off then
pull the sock
now wave the sock
or squeeze it out like that
squeeze

shall I put your sock back on
no
don't throw it
no no no
let's put your sock back on
if you throw it again Warren that bag of toys goes in the hall
you mustn't throw it
you mustn't throw it
you can roll it along the floor but if you throw it that bag of toys goes in the hall
all right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
Mummy will stand in front of the door
one sock on and one sock off
no
that's a horrid
no no
that's a horrid noise
Warren
no
pardon
I'm not sure that I can make a horse with er lego
just let me have a go
you want a horse
let Mummy try and make a horse
I'm not sure that this is entirely successful child but er
does it need a tail
are you undoing your braces
well that's saucy
your nappie's falling down
well
don't take your trousers off
look
I've just made you a horse
let me pull you
your nappie's not falling down pet
no no
don't take your trousers off
no
Warren
why are you taking your trousers off
is it because it's a new skill you've just learned
the slight problem is your braces are still attached at the back so you can't actually pull them down
Warren
you don't take your trousers off when there are visitors here
no no no
young men don't take their trousers off when there are visitors
keep your trousers on
do you like the horse I've made you
no
you ungrateful little beast
I think that's a brilliant horse
considering
I know it's not got ears but you can't have everything
where are you going
no
come back
come back
Warren
you'll just have_to wait
pet
I'm sorry
you'll just have_to wait
yeah I know
it's just not a good time

and where's the special seed holder
oh yes
it's nailed to the side of the house didn't it
and did you watch the birds come
how many birds
lots_of birds
just a few
it's probably a bit chilly for birds
have they
have they gone to sleep
well birds sleep in very special beds called nests
they're not big boys beds like yours
they do peck at the nuts but I don't I think it's a bit late for them now
it's getting a bit starting to get dark
yeah
will you stop fiddling with your trousers
are you pulling it up
that's a good good boy
you deserve a hug for that
hey
shall we have a man riding the horse
it's a very big horse
slightly deformed as_well
it's already got its nose
if you put that one you'll make it look like a
goodness knows what
darling
you've just knocked the head the horse's head off
it'll look like a giraffe with that on mate
okay
let's turn it into a giraffe
shall we make it into a jolly
a jolly giraffe
with its long neck
make a what
no
I can't make Jolly's face
oh it's a horse again now
that's better isn't it

Warren
