a blouse

that's a dress pet
do you want her you want her to wear the dress

you want dolly in trousers or a dress
okay
can you thread her arms through then
Warren put that over her right arm
and the left arm
there you go
dolly's got her dress on just about
well I don't know whether you can well I suppose you can put trousers on over a dress
why not
make her bottom look big though
she wouldn't thank_you for that

another horse
a baby whale
the black bull
the Mummy tiger
a cow

another bull
what's this
what color is it
it is not red and blue
it is pink
but not all pigs are pink
some pigs are black and some pigs are black and white and some pigs are brown
some pigs are gingery colored
oh
what's that
a what
it's a goat
what did you think it was
what's that
yeah
baby chicken

they're chicks as_well
there's a cockerel
and what's this
baa
do you know a song about a sheep
can you sing it for me
go on then
Warren sing it first
Warren sing it then Mummy will sing it
how does it go
baa baa black
come on
sing it
I didn't hear you singing
baa baa black sheep
have you any
mhm
I think that was a somewhat summarized version
Mummy's found another man
no
I've only got one
you have_to look for the others
you've got one there
one here
and there's another one in here somewhere
with a green body and brown hair
look
he's by the engine
yeah
you've got two of them
looks like a bus full of people all them doesn't it
what buss do you know Warren
who's Bulgie
is Bulgie a naughty bus
he does doesn't he
does Warren tell lies
naughty boys do don't they
and you're not a naughty boy
is Bulgie Thomas's friend
is Bertie Thomas's friend
Bertie's a nice bus isn't he
that's not a baby tiger
that's a Mummy tiger
I think they will sit on if you just get that
that's it
yeah
he's sitting on the Mummy tiger now
I'm not sure I'd fancy riding a tiger
what do tigers say
that's right
and tigers can run very fast
they can run faster than hippos
and horses I think
oh
you've got a man on a tiger and a man on a horse
shall we have a man on an elephant
three men riding three animals
that's good isn't it
what is it
can you remember what that bit's called
it's an udder
milk gets squirted out_of these things that hang down and it  collected
and then it's put into bottles
what're you doing
which other one
other what
the hippo
or the man
well look for him
he's got red hair
and a blue top
it's near a horse
lying down
no
he's not on the horse
he's near a lying down horse and the tiger
yeah
have you lost the other man now
you'll have_to move this one over a bit
I hope you learn some logic soon Warren
but what are we going to do with this one
what are we going to do with this one
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
put them on right at the end with a bit sticking out
put him on right at the end with a bit sticking out
right
now get the next one
put it on right next_to that one
right up next_to it
that's it
now put the other one with a bit hanging over the edge
that one goes there yes
yes
see
how many have you got now
how many
count again
one two three
how many
how many
five
okay fine
there might be two invisible men there as_well I suppose
now that's sensible
www
oh
say thank_you to Anna
you don't need that gap
say thank_you to Anna
what're you looking for
other one what
another one what
another one long one
don't let Daddy see you doing that Warren
do you want her trousers on
right
can you undo her velcro please
right
and you take the dress off carefully
that's it
hooray
now then
if we put her legs out
now are you going to thread her legs into the trousers
oh
there's her right foot
and oh her left foot
there she is
she's got her trousers on
is that better
I think she might be a bit cold with just trousers on
are you still sticking those men on
they don't need to go right at the end on this one
because it's a long one
they can go further along
now put it on the floor
now press down on it
I know what you could do Warren
if we took this truck bit off
we could sit the men on here
where's the other man
are you sitting on him
no
oh there he is
right
are you going to stick them on there
then they can go for a ride on the train with the baby tiger looking at them can't they
one two
where's the other one
you had him a minute ago
stand up and have a look
well stand up
where is it
ah
where is it
under the doll's hair
and there I was thinking you were sitting on it
beep
it's a cow
shall we put some cows out so it can catch the cows
oh
oh is it an elephant catcher
or a Mummy tiger catcher
who wants peace and quiet
does Warren want peace and quiet
oh
don't drive over the goat and the pig
oh no
the pig's caught
it's in the carriage
oh no
okay
you're a fine one to talk mate
that's it
Warren
keep it on the carpet
keep it on the carpet
no
that's the Mummy tiger
oh
baby tiger's crying because you've run over his Mummy
shall we wipe his tears away
oh dear
does he need some medicine
why don't you give him a drink of your orange juice
it's there behind the cement mixer lorry
is he drinking
oh he's had enough now I think
you're kind sharing your orange juice with the baby tiger
oh
wipe his tears away and give him a cuddle
yes
Mummy took it off so the so these men could have a ride
what is it
that's it
what does it do
well it does look like a snowplow but it isn't
snowplows are closer to the ground
and are more pointy
yeah
a snowplow is like a cow
you're right
er Toby_the_tram_engine has a cow
yes
it does go there
shall Mummy hold the train while you put it on
those bits go at the bottom
that way up
just there
push it down
that's it
now put this blue square behind it
put the blue square behind it
that's it
now put the funnel on the top
other way round
with the light at the front
that's it
now you can put the cab on
hooray
clever boy
I don't think the wheels pull off pet
pardon
who's taught you that
who's taught you crash bang wallup because it's not me
is it Daddy
does Daddy say crash bang wallup
