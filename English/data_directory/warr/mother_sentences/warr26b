a
that poor little horse being run over by that car
make sure it stays on the road

the motorbike can't fit into the field I don't think can it
that poor horse is rather foolish isn't it going on the track
where's the motorbike off to
oh is it
what's it going to buy

let's have a go let's see if we can get some more vehicles on this car transporter
now these are a bit big that are on aren't they
shall we put some smaller ones on
then we can get more on
right
why don't we put these two on because they're designed to go on there aren't they
motorbike on a car transporter
why don't you look in your box for some smaller cars
hey hey
going going going going going
getting run over
oh there's another one of the cars that's designed to go on the car transporter
I wonder if the train'll stay up there
it might roll backwards pet
oh dear no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that one's too little
these this one fits on quite well doesn't it
yeah well that one's ideal because that's the one that you buy with it
let's see
I wonder if this tractor would fit on
it's too big isn't it
the wheels are too wide
no
that one's just right
that one's too small
I don't know
I wonder if this'll
perfect
what about this one
where did that come from
where did that one come from
oh Warren
that's a dangerous driver in there isn't it
well you'll have_to lift this up and then pull them out
that's it
put him in the tipper truck then
going going going going going going going
it is isn't it
which one are you looking for
oh that's a nice little van isn't it
that's too small isn't it
did you get it from a shop
oh that's a good idea
it's too small to go on the low isn't it but it can go in the bus
can't it
will it fit in the bus
right
you want another one
a little one
here's the breakdown
will that fit
mind you
it might roll back down the ramp
what do you think
what's happening with it now
oh there it is
it's safe in there now isn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
beep
bash
oh no oh no
where's the bus taking that little van
where's it going
where's it going

that's a very windy road isn't it
is it bumpy
is this a dual carriage
or a motorway
is it a dual carriage or a motorway though
what do you mean yeah
yes dual carriage or yes motorway
right
is it broken
oh dear
what's wrong with it
there we go
now all we have_to do is try and find the key so it can come out if they want it to
I've no idea where that little key
ahhah
who says ahhah

sit down
hooray
be gentle with it pet
it's only little that one
don't press too hard
you'll break the wheels pet
no look
you're already starting to damage it Warren
you mustn't press down hard on it
okay
push it gently like that
don't squash it
just push it gently
don't press it down
some vehicles it matter because they're very strong but that  not very strong
gosh
it's going backwards and forwards a lot
does it keep going the wrong way
like Mummy and Daddy did on holiday
we kept going the wrong way didn't we
Mummy would look at the map and say oh no
we should have turned off just there
it is a small road with a fast road round the edge
are you checking there are no trains coming
it does
he's got_to stop there and see if any other vehicles are coming
oh now we're getting a queue aren't we
oh dear
oh dear
what's that horse up to
yeah
oh no
there's another car coming
this is a very long line
shall we find some other animals to keep the horse company
so he doesn't get lonely
there's a rhino
and
a baby tiger
where is it
where is it
in the dumper truck
oh did you have it at Nana's today
it'll still be at Nana's then
what's that you're blowing
what is it
it's a little windmill
from Blackpool
no
don't
of course I'll hold it
may I blow it
Warren blow
you don't need to make that raspberry noise as_well
ugh
that's a horrid noise
oh look
the caravan's in pieces actually
I'll get it out and mend it shall I
if I can find all the pieces
we need the wheels now
there are the wheels
Mummy put it back together
yes please
there you go
where are they going on holiday
oh it's left its caravan behind
that's good
shall I move the baby tiger so it doesn't get hurt
and then look at Gordon
it's a very bendy road isn't it for a car and caravan
very bendy for a tractor as_well
the tractor and trailer
the wrong way round
you have_to move the caravan round or move the car
how many people are in the car
what are they called
two ladys
what are the ladys names
pardon
Stuart and
Imogen
do you like Imogen
and Oliver
that's right
Imogen and
did you did you like Imogen and Oliver
was it fun playing with the big boy and big girl
mhm
that was a narrow gap for it to squeeze through
that was a very narrow gap
hey ho
that's the wrong way round
oh no
it's off the track
oh that's it
oh
just got back on in time didn't it
oh no
you've knocked something else off
poor little vehicle
gosh
that's a long line of cars isn't it
have they stopped at the traffic lights
yeah but why are they stopping
is the rhino jumping
Humpty_Dumpty sat on a nothing
Humpty_Dumpty had a great nothing
all the king's horses and all the kings nothings
couldn't put Humpty together again
that's a funny old song
Humpty_Dumpty sat on the nothing
what are you doing
I think the crane might be at Nana's house
because you're going to Nana's tomorrow you see
and the toys that you had there today Daddy's left
collect it
where from
somewhere yeah
but where somewhere
I think it is at Nana's somewhere
I don't think it can be anywhere else because I think all your vehicles are in your vehicle box aren't they
I don't think there are any messy ones
oh they've moved on a bit along the road haven't they
have the lights changed
don't go too fast with that caravan
that's fine
no
that's your windmill
oh can't blow it from here
Warren try blowing hard
no
no you don't need to make all that horrible wet noise
come on
try again
you have_to blow hard
that's horrid
what a horrid wet noise
no no
my arm was in the way then and that was truly horrible
oh
blow down your nose
Mummy needs a clean hankie doesn't she really
done a_lot_of wiping of your nose
right
I shall put
if you do that again I shall put the windmill away on a high shelf
I don't want you doing those horrible wet blows
no
no wet blows
just dry ones
oh
that's come right round again hasn't it
how's the caravan moving by itself
got no engine
oh well
never mind
why is it
why is it stuck
oh
listen to those wheels rushing round
can't go
why not
well I think it will go faster there because it's smoother than the carpet isn't it
also it's a fast road
