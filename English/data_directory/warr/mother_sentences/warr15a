that doesn't work does it
you have_to shake it
shake the teddys out
because they don't get hurt because they're in the water
they're out now

is that to stop them from escaping
shall we put you could put the polar bear in the wheelbarrow
how much
how much money
has he bought the baby polar bear off the lady with the wheelbarrow

why not
I'm sure polar bears can ride in cars
is that man looking after the polar bear to make sure he doesn't escape
he's having a sip is he
what's what is it he's drinking
is it water or milk
cold water
yes
that's what baby tigers drink isn't it
cold water
don't drive too fast
that baby polar bear might get sick
where are they taking him
oh
what's he going to do at the park
he's going to what in the mud and the water
oh
that'll be nice
because polar bears like playing in water
so do tigers
they like water as_well
they're good swimmers
who's the lady got in her wheelbarrow now
who's in her wheelbarrow
why is he in the wheelbarrow do you think
can you remember how to mend it
can you remember how to mend it
you have_to make sure the legs are down and the arms are out
and then you go
hold the hands still and then go pop pop
there you are
oh we've got a man pushing the wheelbarrow now
he can push the old lady
he's off I she
where's he off to
yeah
the thing is Warren
this trailer doesn't fit on that car

a different kind of vehicle
that trailer fits on that car
yeah
have you

why don't you try one of those keys in your treasure chest to see if it'll open it
can you open the lid now
oh yes
is Henry going to have a cup of tea

I'm not sure I fancy the idea of tea and coffee mixed
right
shall we put shall we give put some water into Henry
where's his tender
that's where Henry stores most of his water isn't it
in his tender

fill up the tanks at the bottom
there you go
put some more coal in as_well
oh coal coming out_of the teapot as_well
I always thought your tea was a bit strong
that explains it
it's made with coal

don't throw it in
put it in carefully
that's it
there's the red cup
there's the red cup

don't tip that out
what color's the taxi

and Bulgie's a mean scarlet deceiver
here's Thomas at the station again picking up his passengers
oh look
where is he now
yes
it's a different bridge isn't it
yeah

it's you can see the mountain through the tunnel
and that's a big water wheel
there's a mill here for grounding corn to make flour
and water comes onto this wheel
the wheel turns and that's what makes the
that's what makes the corn grind
oh what's happening to Thomas here
