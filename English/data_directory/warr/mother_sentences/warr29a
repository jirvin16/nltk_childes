no
you can look later
tell you what
I'll just go and get your other your bag of toys because we brought a whole bag of toys didn't we
here they are
here they are
what can you find in there
because you've been so busy playing in the garden we've not had time to get those out yet
what's in there
a
right
shall we open the bag over here
bring your stuff over here
shall I put your track out so you can play with your vehicles on the track
I'll put it out over here where there's a nice big space
oh your sticker's over here as_well
you'd better put your sticker on
that says you've been to the dentist doesn't it
or shall I put the sticker on your ambulance
has the ambulance been to the dentist
let's get this flat
it's a bit creased isn't it where it's been in the bag
there you go
do you want a boat on the canal
what are these doing in your toy bag
those smelly old pumps
where's that road gone
has it fallen off the edge of the hill
is the ambulance going to turn round
yeah
yeah
that's a good idea
yeah
there is I think isn't there
and look
we've got a road sign here
are you going to put that near a junction
no
I don't think we've got any trains actually
don't think we put any in did we
well I think it's a bit too far to go back home to get them sweetheart
we could pretend these bricks were trains couldn't we
choo
shall we flatten this out a bit more
that's the problem with it being folded up
screwed up in the bag
there we go
oh yes
oh yes
why has it had to stop
is there a train coming
oh
so it has
shall we get some more vehicles out
move what
that's the car that goes in your car transporter isn't it
so it is
have we got the parts to mend it
I don't think we have
here's the wheels
we haven't got any other bits
I can guess who put these two pieces in the bag
Warren
that's not much good is it
that's very broken
it's missing two pieces
we can't mend it without them
mhm
that's right
we can certainly mend it when we get home
oh look at them
they're not that new
we bought them to go on holiday didn't we
the problem is sweetheart
you've got three three lots_of puzzle piece all mixed up
well I'll put them into piles of puzzles
okay
this is the parrot puzzle
that can go there
you want to do the lion puzzle
okay
let's find the lion puzzle pieces then
okay
here are the lion puzzle pieces
two four six eight
those are the lion pieces
there's the panda pieces
if you chew them mate they're going
oh there's another lion piece
why don't you do the lion one
don't put them in your mouth please
why don't you do the lion one
I think there might be some more missing
or is there
oh no
there are nine pieces
no
that's right
snap snap
ouch
well why don't you put the puzzle together
shall we do it on why don't you do it on the carpet
then it's easier to see what the pattern is on the pieces
how do they fit together now
is that a good fit
rubbish
you need the curly tail
you need the end of the baby lion's tail
it's curling
try that one again
is that a good fit
no
well you try it
you try it at the top corner
it's got whiskers on
is that a good fit
it does go there
you try it again
there you go
is that a good fit
it is isn't it
you've nearly finished it
only two more pieces
right
which do you want to do next
the snaky one
okay
those are snaky ones
shall I move this and then we've got more space on the carpet here
mind your bot
there you go
we can put the mat out again later
let's get these all turned up the right way
this has got more pieces in so it's more difficult
uhoh
uhoh
no
why don't we look for pieces with the snake on
can you find pieces with the purple on like that
yeah
now find another piece with purple on
no
that one doesn't
find all the pieces with purple on
you've got those two
are there any more pieces with purple on like that
look no
the pieces are all here
can you see any pieces here with purple on
that one
okay
we'll put that over here
can you see any more
no
find all the pieces with purple
find all the
are there any more pieces with purple
just there
that's it
are there any more pieces with purple on here
right
so now these pieces must go together because they've got the same sort of color on
that's it
good boy
it certainly does
so where does that piece go
do you think
are you sure
what about here
lots_of purple missing there
it would help if the picture were the right way round
look
now you've got the snake
there's just a little bit of his nose missing
you look for a piece of puzzle with tiny tiny pieces of purple on
two tiny pieces of purple
do you think
what about that
has that got tiny pieces of purple on to go on the snake's nose
oh yes
and what what's this
that's the parrot's nose
can you find the rest of the parrot's head
no
there's only one eye because the other eye's on the other side of his head
no
it can't can it
no
need a piece with two straight edges
can you see how that one's got two straight edges
we need a straight edge there and a straight edge there
can you see one with a little bit of carrot on
carrot
parrot on and some leafs
there we go
try the other way round
that's it
there you go
finished that one
which one are you going to do
the giraffe one
do you think
do you think
maybe you need some more pieces before that one will fit on properly
I don't think that one will fit on straight away will it
two what

that's right
two giraffes
no
you've got these pieces here as_well
where are they going to go
I beg your pardon
oh no
you're dribbling
dribbling

take it out
take it out
put it down down the ambulance
aren't you going to finish the puzzle
no
I don't want you putting that in your mouth
oh
if you put it in your mouth Warren it goes away on a high shelf where you can't reach it
because it's not safe for little boys to put in their mouths
well I'm going to do this puzzle
you want to help
can you tell me where this piece goes please
yeah
I think it does
you're very clever
twaddle
it does not go there
