okay
let's play rolly rolly
right
roll it to me then
oh
it's one o'clock
right
let's roll it back
are you ready to catch it
oh it hit my foot
oh my poor foot
thank_you pet
that's much better now
shall Henry roll it to you
Henry's going to roll it to you
that missed
where is it
it's underneath the bookshelf I think isn't it
oh Warren
that will make a nice loud noise
well I don't think it's broken
I hope it's not broken
it might be broken
yeah
you would be in trouble
phew
just mind my tea
oh is the tender going to roll it
right
right
let's see if Henry can catch it
oh
the rabbit caught it
right
Henry'll send it again
brumm
that's not a train noise is it
chuff
beep
Henry's better than the tender isn't he
perfect
what what are the pictures inside this ball that turn round
oh
that nearly hit your cake
it did hit your cake again
it's a saucy ball isn't it
whoops
thank_you
oh that was my knuckle
no
it was my knuckle
no
it's absolutely sweet of you to kiss my leg but it was actually my knuckle that it hit but never mind
count to three
whoops
this ball is supposed to be played with in the bath Warren
see if we can get it whizzing round again shall we
there we go
look at it spinning round in the middle
Henry's not very good at it is he
Henry's getting bored
he wants to go on the track
let's see if we can put some more exciting things on this track for Henry to play with
yeah
that's probably a good idea isn't it
shall we put a lion in the field
which field shall the lion go in
okay
where's this lion from
it was off Adam's birthday cake
that's right
can you remember how many candles Adam had
hooray
did you
yeah
hey it's good playing in here
because we don't have_to rush anywhere to look out_of the window at the ambulances do we
we see lots_of ambulances don't we
so did I
those two lovely animals
what kind of lovely animals are they
well you tell me what are they
what kind of animal are they
are they lions
what are they
they're sheep with long long horns aren't they
we saw some sheep the other day with long horns
and we saw some goats with long long horns as_well didn't we
the goats had longer horns than the sheep had
you're an elephant
I always thought there was something strange about you
is that what it is
you're an elephant
and I always thought you were a boy
a level crossing is it
there's some vehicles waiting at the level crossing
wrong vehicle waiting
which vehicle should it be
no
they don't
no
they don't come on roads
do they
I don't think
trams do sometimes but trains don't
and Henry is definitely a train
he's not a tram
yes
trams do but trains don't
trains stay on rails
no
because the problem is
you're not going to listen to reason are you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
we saw a helicopter this morning didn't we
is the helicopter in here
are its rotor in there because they were kicking about in your bed weren't they
I think your rotor may be somewhere missing
maybe I vacuumed them up last night
yes
keys for the windows of our last house
yes
they are your keys
there's one of those keys that we need to post back
yeah
your rotor aren't here I'm afraid
no
that's not right
this is the key for that
shall we wind it up
no
don't bash it
I don't think so
make sure you don't run over your biscuit
it was
well keep the wheels on the floor while you wind it up
otherwise it'll just unwind
bash
what are you after
right okay
the problem is it's a very strong train
it might knock them over
but it's a very good idea
oh no
it can't
it's all fenced in isn't it
is there another one
I didn't know that we had more than three
that's right
and Warren
you know Gnome
her boyfriend drives a policecar
he's just learning how to drive it very fast so he can chase people
is that exciting
you've never been in a fire have you
you've never been in an ambulance either
perhaps one day you might be able to go in an ambulance in the ambulance station down the road
well they do go
well it might fall off
yes
what a funny thing
did you
what
just now
just drove past
who knocked the lion over
a
where's Gnome
Gnome's in the hall talking to Daddy
Gnome's going to go to the shops with Daddy
no
we're going to some shops with Daddy and Gnome this afternoon
and you're going to buy a vehicle
you're going to choose one aren't you
we're going to go to a vehicle shop and you will choose one
because you have just had your tenth night without a dummy
it's a good job you survived because we didn't have any to give you as spares
no
it hasn't
bye
are you going to wave out_of the window
I hadn't realized the wind man was here
look
there's the wind man van wind man's van
he has
I bet they flash orange don't you
he's mending our leaky wind
Mummy got wet feet didn't she on the way back from Irene'shouse
Mummy shrieked and said oh what's that on my foot
and I couldn't stop and look could I because we were on a windy country lane in the pouring rain and there was nowhere to stop
and then a bit later on
oh what's that on my other foot
is that what happens in the rain
you sometimes play out in the rain don't you
that's right
and what do you have on your feet
that's right
you've got shoes on now
and I think you're going to need new shoes
I hope
right
before I forget Warren
shall we put the answerphone on
actually no
we'll leave it off
because it'll probably be quicker for me actually to answer the phone
no
we'll leave it on because otherwise we'll have_to um listen to the message
and it might be something secret and private
mightn't it
you want to see that man
well he's in the garage
you'll be able to see him in a few minutes
he'll be a little while he'll be quite a while mending the wind
no
not this window
the wind on the car
the thing you look out_of at the front
yeah
with the little stickers on
he's he's mending it
because it's leaking
Mummy got wet feet
and we got a wet carpet
are you sleeping
a
I've no idea where
oh it popped
I do know where it is
it popped
it did
Daddy Daddy
who was Daddy with when it popped
Malcolm
do you remember when
oh no
you were in bed
no
you weren't in bed
when Malcolm came and Mummy was ironing and you were watching the dog and the cat and you were playing with your balloon weren't you
then Mummy took you up for your bath
and Daddy and Malcolm were sitting in the kitchen having a drink and suddenly the balloon went pop
and it burst
and Daddy doesn't know why it went pop because it was just sitting there
it does
balloons do pop if you sit on them generally
don't they
you had a really good one
a shiny one that went float float float in the air
they did
that's right
and James came off the rails in a field didn't he with some animals in it
can you remember what the animals were in the field where James came off the rails
what were they
they were
cows weren't they
you have tipped haven't you
oh dear
shall oh let's get the crane to lift you up
here's the crane
let's lift the boy
let's hook this round
oh it's not on very well
let's tuck it in
right
up you come
come on
the crane's lifting you
come on
up you come
oh it's come unhooked
let's hook it in again
let's hook it in here
lift the boy
lift him up
up you come
hooray
that's a good crane isn't it that can lift boys up
it probably would lift the sheep up actually
we shouldn't really be playing with these
these are Daddy's sheep
never mind
look at that
a sheep on a crane
brumm
which field's he going in
is he going in the field with the lion and the cows
it's a bit of a dangerous field for sheep because lions like eating sheep
they probably like eating cows actually
never mind
tell you what
shall we put the sheep in the field with Terrence the tractor
there's one sheep with Terrence
what're you doing
are you trying to lift the other sheep
you hook it on then
oh
he is isn't he
poor Terrence with a sheep standing on him
they do keep falling on the rail
I hope Henry doesn't come and run that sheep over
will Henry stop
that's good
so what's going to happen
what can Henry do
can he
a flying train
is that because he's called the Flying_Kipper sometimes
this tunnel
Henry's tunnel
yes
it's not a very good idea kneeling like that
right
can you just stand up
I'll move my legs and then you can kneel properly like that
no
you just turn one round
that's it
okay
yeah
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
where's the other one
oh I hope it's not lost
where is it
ahhah
there it is
no
the ball's too big
other way round
that's it
you want to make a garage
well you can't really make a garage out_of track
because a garage is a building isn't it that things go inside
no
it's not
well let's mend it then
oh you want it broken
Henry will crash
Henry will get derailed
excellent
if you turn the bridge round
there Warren
turn the bridge round
it'll fit now
that's it
they can
shall we make a track that goes under the bridge
right
let's get some more track
make this track go under the bridge
where's your tractor
I've no idea where your tractor is
look in your vehicle box
I don't think it'll fit under the bridge my love
no
so we need another little short long short straight bit
not short long
keep this curving round
what do you mean hey
hey
hey
hey ho
make a bumpy track
well that is a bumpy old track isn't it
move your feet
oh yes
I see what you mean
no straights in it
right

are there any more bumpy bits
no
there aren't
we'll have_to do our best here with
Warren
what are you talking about
they're not Christmas trees
they're bits of track
don't don't bend it too much because it might break
all right
now we've got a we've got a problem here mate
we have
willn't willn't willn't
rats
rats rats
right
going going going going going going going going going going going going
so it'll fit
rats rats
ahhah
there we go
look at it
it's a good track isn't it
whoops
here's Henry
chuff
where's his tender
tender was playing with the ball before wasn't it
where is it now
is it in the box
oh I can see his tender
it's over here
here it is
oh look at that
well we'll have_to move that then
that's a funny old thing on the bridge
it might bump into Henry
oh no
hey
Henry's in his tunnel
oh dear oh dear
what a thing
yes
you say it's derailed
if the wheels are off the track it's derailed
are they happy_birthday trees
good
what kind of creatures are those Warren
yes
a big rabbit and a little rabbit isn't there
oh no
that's the wrong way round
that's it
Henry's on the transporter where you put him
his tender's on the track
yes Warren
