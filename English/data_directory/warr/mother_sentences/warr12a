well actually those bits don't go together
right
now then
let's have a look at these pieces
get them all the right side up
right
let's look at that one Warren
that one's got some red ball on it with white spots
can you find another piece with red on it
color like that
red color
can you find another piece
another piece with red on it
no
that's not red
that's brown
that doesn't go there does it
there must be another piece with red on
a there it is
there
right now we've got the ball haven't we
and look
there's the puppy's leg
look
we're starting to get the puppy's head now
oh yes
which bit of the puppy is that
what are these
those are his eyes aren't they
so this is the other puppy isn't it
can we find some more bits of this puppy
can you find the puppy's nose
you find the puppy's nose
can you find a black nose
yeah so_that piece fits on there
do you want to put it on
just there
Warren do it
that's it
brilliant
now then
what do we need
that bit goes there
that's it
and that bit goes there
where does that piece go
oh yes
well I think that goes there
maybe
brilliant
there it goes
I've got two bits
these need to fit together at some point
right
what about that piece
yeah
what about that piece
no
it's got a bit of a flower at the bottom
where are the flowers
that's it
brilliant
well look
now this has got a straight edge so_that has_to go along an edge somewhere
I think that might go there
there it goes
and where do you think this bit goes
whoops
that's right
that bit goes just there
so we need a piece to fit this hole
can you see a piece like that
other way round
other way up
you match the white bit with the white fur and the brown bit with the brown fur
that's it
now we're left with these two pieces
where do they go
does that fit
does that fit
I don't think it does
what about trying it here
hooray
so where does that bit go
look
now this has got a straight edge hasn't it
and that has_to go along there
so where does the piece go
that's it
brilliant
two puppys
and a ball in the garden with flowers
you want to put it away
you don't want to do it again
shall we get that kitten out
now are you going to chew the pieces like you did last time
do you remember the last time you played with it ages ago we had to put it up on the bookshelf
because you were chewing it and spoilt it
and there are big gaps where there shouldn't be
I don't know why I'm bothering because it always falls apart when I put it in but never mind
slide in
we'll find that kitten
there's only one kitten
it's a kitten and a puppy
byebye puppys
here we are
there's the kitten
oh no
all three puzzles are mixed up
look
look what you did you terrible child
look
bite marks
big gaps
now we've got three puzzles here
right
yes
you weren't popular
no
that one doesn't go there
what I'll do is sweetheart
bless you
bless you
bless you
quickly do these
and work out what goes where
does it
er no
I don't think it does
that goes there
I'm getting through this one
I can see a brick wall
that's why I couldn't work it out
because the blue had gone because somebody chewed it off
you did bite it there
you terrible boy
don't you dare bite it again
bite it again and it goes away again
you've not had this out for weeks
and it's missing some pieces I think
is it
hang on hang on
a you see
that bit goes there
that bit goes
oh it's not missing pieces at all
it's just me being daft
now Warren
look at that one
I can see you through it
can you see Mummy through the puzzle
we'll put that one away for the minute and we'll put that one away for the minute
get those out later
right
can you do this puzzle
take it apart
and if you chew it it goes away again
no
don't chew it please
right
there's the dog's body
where's the dog's head
where's the dog's head
well fit it onto the body then
er there's the front of his body with his front leg
that's it
good boy
now where's the dog's ear
where's the dog's ear
and his eye
and part of a blue ball
there's one eye
where's his other eye and his ear
okay
no
that one does go there
you just tried putting it in the wrong way round
now look
there's a hole there
which that sticky out bit goes in
that's it
hooray
now where's the dog's back leg
no
there's another piece before that because look
part of the cat's face is missing
can you find the other bit of the cat's face
yeah
so those two go together
that's it
and then that bit goes on here
to finish off the dog's other ear and his back
no
look at the shape of the pieces
look
there's a gap there for a sticky out bit to go in
that's it
now there's one piece left
where does that go
is that finished
and what's happening on that picture
where's the cat
in the window
that's right
the cat's stuck in the shed I think
and she's meowing to try and get out
are you going to put it in there
thank_you
shall we do another one now
break this one up
it's only got one piece chewed out_of it
look
chewed piece
right
where are you going to start
yeah
can you find another bit with blue on it
that is the cat's ear I think
no
because the cat's eye has_to go there
can you find the cat's other ear
there's one ear there
where the cat's other ear
yes
that's a brush but where's the cat's other ear
where's the cat's other ear
there's one ear there
where's the cat's other ear
that's right
and ears go next_to each_other so where must that ear go
hooray
yes
that must go there
no
find a
there's a piece here Warren with blue on it
that's it
that's the cat's tail isn't it sticking up
now there's two pieces left
where do they go
but Warren
that's got blue
it must be a blue bit that goes there
that's not blue
that's grey
well I suppose it's a kind of pinkie color
and does that go there Warren
does that look right
yes
hooray
so where must that go
and why does that look funny
oh is it because somebody's chewed a piece out
are you going to put it in there
then we can do the last one which has got lots_of holes in
one more
look at all the holes in this one
this is where the kitten comes out_of the shed
mix the pieces up
can you find bits that go together
you see the dog's ears
aren't you going to do this puzzle
is it too hard
yeah
it's not too hard is it
no
that mustn't go there
look
well there's the cat's face
where's the cat's body
where's the cat's body
it's not a nappie
it's a bit of white fur in the cat's chest
cats don't wear nappies
because cats are grown up creatures
they know where to do things unlike somebody
shall Mummy do this one
where does it go
no
you were trying to put it in the right place
you were just being
no
that does go there
and where do these two pieces go
turn it round
that's it
turn it round
because you've got_to have blue on this side of it haven't you
you need to look at the colors as_well_as the shapes
that's it
brilliant
okay
you put them in there
another one
I don't think we've got any more
which other one
we haven't got any more up there
haven't got any more
because the er fire one has disappeared
I wonder where on earth it is
yes
that was underneath the er chair
that's why it was on the floor
because it was under the chair
why don't you do one of these another one of these again
yes
are you reading a story
what does it say
right
which one are you doing first
which one are you going to do first
there's three puzzles
which one are you doing first
okay
no
put that back in then it's easier when we want to do it again
when you want to do it again
yes
that one comes apart easily doesn't it
why is it coming apart easily
because somebody's chewed all the bits off
this was a Christmas present from Father_Christmas wasn't it
and you've chewed it
there we go
what's happening in the pictures
is the dog sad
what's he what's he doing
did he open the door
and let the kitten out_of the shed
mhm
because the kitten was stuck in the shed wasn't she
she couldn't open the door
and there she is peeping out
meowing so the puppy will hear
and then the puppy comes and opens the door and lets her out
I don't think we've got any other ones
we've got this one
shall we make Thomas
do you want just Thomas or Thomas and Percy
oh look Warren
there are two sparrows on the nuts
oh
Warren look
there's another bird on the nuts
it's a blue
there were two on there earlier weren't there
what's he doing
that's right
those nuts last better on that branch don't they because the squirrel can't get them
yeah
I don't know what the other bird is
it's not the same as
careful
they're my legs
who's the book about
is he red
what happens to James
is he sad
yes
he is laughing there isn't he
well do you really want a story
shall we do the puzzle with Thomas and Percy
let's make Thomas and Percy
you can help Mummy can't you
you can help Mummy to make Thomas and Percy
let's get the pieces out
let's get them the right way out the right way round for Thomas and Percy
right
can you see Percy's face
where's Percy's face
there
okay
where's Percy's boiler
okay
so those bits must go together mustn't they
hooray
now who's that next_to Percy
right
so Thomas's face needs to go there doesn't it
can you find Thomas's face
don't turn it over
it has_to go that way round
right
can you see Thomas's funnel
remember Thomas has got a short
no
that's the steam from his funnel
where's his funnel
that's Percy's funnel actually so_that piece goes up here
that piece goes above here
see Percy's funnel at the bottom
the very top of Percy's funnel
now we need the piece to go here which has got Thomas's funnel in
no
that goes there because that's Percy's funnel
where's Thomas's funnel
yeah
so you put that piece in
hooray
two smokes
yes
two lots two lots_of smoke I think you'd probably say
whose wheels
rubbish
Henry's not on here
whose wheels are they
Percy's wheels
and his wheels go under his cab where his driver and fireman go
now where's Percy's buffers
okay
and they go next_to his wheels
where are Thomas's
can you see Thomas's
that does go there
can you turn it round so it's the right way round
no
that's the wrong picture
it's the other picture
that's it
brilliant
Warren
we've not finished this picture yet
right
now here there are some children on a bridge
no
bridge not fridge
no
it's not a fridge darling one
it's a bridge
a fridge
are the children on a fridge
it does go there
hooray
where do those last two go
do those look right
hooray
see whose eye
Thomas's eye
there it is
beep
Percy's eyes are there
what does Thomas say
peep lazy bones
peep lazy bones
there they are
what have you found
James isn't blue
he's red
the book's blue but James is red
is he pink
I don't think there are any pink engines
Warren
I'm not a climbing frame you know
cheeky
come on then
do some press
press
can you do press
Mummy do
do you know what a press up is
because I couldn't show you one
don't sit on my knees
oh look
there are two birds on the nuts
the call of the red engine
well we started this story before didn't we
we were reading it when the doorbell went
remember James lets off steam
and he blows off the Fat_Controller's top hat
oh no
he doesn't blow it off
he gets water all over it
that's right
who's James pulling the train with
that's right
so how many engines are pulling it
how many engines are pulling the train
there's two
one two
is Edward happy
I wonder why
here we go
oh what's happened here
who's that
is Thomas happy as_well
I think he is
he's telling James and Edward how important he is
oh look at those two faces
James is saying it's ever so steep
it's ever so steep
it's ever so steep
and Edward's saying I've done it before
I've done it before
I've done it before
www
and look at all the steam coming out_of their funnels
they're really having to puff hard to get up that hill
here they are at the next station
James is laughing
www
and who's that
and what's he wearing
yeah
and why was James worried about seeing the Fat_Controller
because the day before James had blown steam at him and got the top hat wet
poor Fat_Controller with a wet top hat
