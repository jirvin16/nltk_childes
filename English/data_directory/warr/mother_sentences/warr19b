and then there's a g for a g for Granddad
a o for orange
that's a g for Granddad
and that's the o for orange

look at this writing

no
that's a u for umbrella
that's an o for orange
never mind
shall we see what's in the box
who is it
what's she called
what's the dolly called
she's just called dolly is she
has she
that's handy
she's not wearing trousers
she was wearing a dress
well this dress undress at the back
there you go
can you take it off her now
oh dear
her hair's caught in it isn't it
can you pull the dress off gently if Mummy holds dolly
she has
they're not stripy ones like yours though are they
she's got ordinary pants on
no
I think she needs to keep her pants on because you keep your pants on don't you
dolly wants to keep her pants on
that's the cab of the locomotive
that's actually the funnel but never mind
that's right
and you've got a cab and a foot
you went on the foot of a steam train didn't you at the weekend
you did
do you remember that hot hot fire that we saw
with the firemen putting lots_of coal on
well that's a funny place to sit on top of the cab roof
is that so he gets a good view of where he's going
that's a good idea
is he going to put some more water in the tender as_well
Warren
you have_to make sure it's sort of square on the engine
you need to move over a little bit
that's it
how many trailers are there
you can put whatever you like on it I guess
oh yeah
what color is it

why don't you leave the man on
whoops
do you want to sit on your pottie to do it
okay then
stand up
are you going to take your pull your trousers and pants down
yes you can
yes you can
they're half way down already
okay
now you sit on your pottie then
whoops
wonderful
how nice
how kind of you to tell us
let's tuck that willie away shall we
oh I can see a boy in the television
and he's wearing red stripy pants
he has got red stripy pants on
red and white stripes
they're very smart
let's pull your trousers up before something desperate happens
shall I put a dress on the doll so she doesn't get cold
I think she's getting cold
some of her hair's falling out isn't it
it's a right tip like Mummy's hair is sometimes
that's better
can you redo her hair
then she can have a nice bow
isn't that a nice bow
do you want that in your hair
would Warren like a bow in his hair
I'll see who that is
I don't think your hair's long enough now
you look like one of those little Yorkshire terriers
oh Shirley_Temple eat your heart out
you look a right duckie
look in the look in the television
look at your hair with your bow
can you see it
you look just like Shirley_Temple
the dolly's hair needs combing really doesn't it
I've not got a comb
can you pass me the bow please
can you pass me the red ribbon
right
just bring it over to me because I don't want you to
that's it
thank_you
I'll undo this
you having done it up nice and tight
are you going to choose something for the doll to wear
so you should be
choose something for the doll to wear please
well make a field then
there's the big board
who are you going to put in the field
are you going to put cows in
or the sheep
I don't mean sheep
I mean pigs
are you going to put the pigs in
now what's the doll going to wear
she's a bit cold
she's shivering look
she's cold
what should she wear
right
let's put her blouse on underneath then
put her arms in
I thought she was wearing the trousers pet
I think the trousers are a good idea because it's a bit cold outside isn't it
you need nice warm clothes on when it's cold out
right
take her blouse off then
thread in the left arm
and the right arm
let's fasten her up
Warren
you are too fickle
do you know where can you find her sandals in the box do you think
not candle
sandals
they're little shoes
have you seen them anywhere
oh yes
where's his car
is that Warren's car
whose car is it
well panda had better sit in otherwise we might think it belongs to somebody else
here's one of the doll's shoes
no
not a candle darling
a sandal
where do we have sandals
Gordon_Bennet
I'm at it now
where do we have candles
yeah
and we have them on cakes don't we
what kind of cakes do we have candles on
that's right
whose birthday cake did we see at the weekend with a candle on it
baby Adam's birthday cake
who blew the candle out
yeah
baby Adam's too little
oh dear
can't see her other shoe
she'll have_to have one shoe on and one shoe off
it's probably in here somewhere
what a terrible noise these bricks make
ahhah
ahhah
yes
she can have warm feet now
no darling
sandal
sandal
the boiler
that's right
in the train
that's right
what did the train say
it did
yeah it did
you sat on the train and you looked out_of the windows didn't you
you waved at people
some people waved back
poop went the train
are you making the gates so_that the cows can get in and out
that's a good idea isn't it
they're in here
there's one cow
shall we see if we can find some more cows
oh
is that a cow
what is it
what is it
no
it's a goat
its nose
find some more cows
is this a cow
well that's a bull but that'll do
a Mummy cow and a Daddy cow or a bull
what's the bull
what's the bull got on its head
it's got ears and what are these
no
they're horns
horns
some cows have horns as_well
there's another cow
it's a brown and white cow
oh here's a horse
oh it's a sleeping horse
oh stand up horse
that's right
shall the goat sleep too
and the cow
oh they're all sleeping
shall we tuck them up under a blanket
there
are they nice and warm
are they cosy
gosh
they've all woken up
they're in that field now
well I think they've gone to sleep again
have they gone to sleep again
well we could do
no
maybe not
no
it's all right
just ignore what I was going to say
yeah
oh look who else is going to come into the field
cluck
a hen and her chicks
cluck
it's a baby horse
what's this
no darling
it's not a little lamb
I'll give you a clue
woof
what is it
yeah
this is a special dog that looks after sheep
it's a sheepdog
woof
well that's so the little chicks don't get lost because if these were separate little figures like this and these are so tiny they would get lost wouldn't they
and then the children would cry because they'd lost their Mother hen and her chicks
oh you've got a warm tummy
I hope that car's not going to drive over my legs
is it
oh no
help help
hello panda
is he waving back
that's nice
bye
is it
oh
nee
brumm
chuff under the bridge
nee over the bridge
nee
well you'd better sit on your pottie then
come on
Warren
pottie
because we don't want anything terrible in your nice stripy pants do we
well you just sit there for a minute just in_case
just in_case some comes creeping out
oh so you have
somewhere
has Daddy got ears
has the doll got ears
has the horse got ears
has the hen got ears
well it does have somewhere but you can't actually see them
it's got some things that look a bit like ears but I don't think they are
well that's all right
it's much better that you should sit on the pottie and not do one
than do one in your pants isn't it
no
I don't think there are candles in there my love
I was saying sandal
which man
he was putting more coal in
why was he putting more coal in
