we've got some ambulances live near our house haven't we
sometimes we see four ambulances parked outside
there is a little one that hides sometimes isn't there
because it's smaller than the others
and if it's parked between two big ones you can't see it
are you hiding like the ambulance
are you trying to creep behind the chair

why don't you go home
that's right
now that's a good idea
look at your itchy nose
Warren
you're a mess
you are a mess

I can see somebody peeping
somebody with an egg
a squashed egg

I'm just making it look better
where are the other eggs
where are the other two eggs
the other big one and the little one
where are they

you'll have_to creep in and bring them back then
Warren
you're a shocker
where are they

you don't want to break it do you
poor Granddad if you broke his chair
he would
he may be a strong man but he would cry if you broke his chair
and you don't want to make Granddad cry do you
you might make Anna cry if you bite the eggs

so what's lion going to eat
is he

mm
lion's still hungry
lion would like a cake for pudding I think
