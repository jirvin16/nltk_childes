where's the train driver
is he in there
huh
what does huh mean
does it mean yes
right
now what's missing off that train
oh
well I don't know that it's missing
what's in a funny place on that train
have a look at this train
what's funny about it
you don't have funnels on cabs do you
you put the funnel where it ought_to be
is that one going to drive
don't do what again
let's have a go
you see
it might not
there
there he is
baby tiger driving
now you put the train back together again
are you sure it goes that far back
I think that goes a bit nearer the front because you wouldn't be able to fit you try and fix the coach the truck on
willn't willn't willn't willn't
you move the you move the cab a bit further forwards
that's it
and you need the funnel and the dome
where's the funnel and dome
that's it
another one
can't you wait
you can't wait
well if you can wait then
do you need to go right now
no
it's not locked
it's just closed so_that you can't get out
right
well say excuse me to Anna again
right
come on then mate
right well you'd better come on then
you go on down
you go down
right then
wipe your nose
where's your nose
blow down it
great flapping lips
oh yes
I don't know that it's new
is it
all right
no
it's not
it's Anna's trailer
don't know if your trailer's here
no
it isn't
your trailer like that one isn't is at home
whose car is it
mhm
is it
how many wheels has it got
oh yes
it's like an owl looking backwards
is that a policecar
well why is it saying nee
oh right
that's it
police mini car sounds better doesn't it
than policecar mini car
I don't know where her pants are
can't see her pants Warren
maybe she's lost them
perhaps she ought_to go and buy some new ones
who bought new pants today
who did
yes
what are they like
are they posh
they're very posh aren't they
I think the doll I think you ought_to take the dolly shopping
and you could buy her some pants
I can't see them anywhere
yeah
poor doll with no pants
what actually
which mat
this mat
why don't you put it here where there's a nice big space
look at this big space
the doll wants to watch what you're going to do with it
if she can stay sitting up long enough
she wants to watch what you're doing
you come and put the mat here
that's it
do you
well shall we move these bits then so we can make a bridge
want a wide bridge
oy
that spanged across and hit me mate
a
that's all right Warren
let you off
you apologize very sweetly
but then you are a sweet youth sometimes aren't you Warren
aren't you
you're lovely
sometimes
I am making you a bridge
I think a car probably will go under
now I need some more big pieces
right
now don't you press on it because you'll probably break it dear
just like I've done
silly Mummy
what has she done
no Warren
don't you apologize
it's my useless bridge
isn't it useless
well I suppose you could do actually
let me just swipe these
can't you
you can
where are they
oh that's her shoe isn't it
I wonder where her pants are
she had them last week
yeah
well
they might be some they might be in the other bag of stuff mightn't they
let's get this bridge finished shall we
whoops
yes it can
the panda can't
or can he
just fits
make the bridge a bit taller
I'm making it taller now
whoops
oh
right
Mummy lift it up
putting everything
even this
oh look at these
this is a very fancy bridge
oh yes
have you seen any pigs
where did you see them
can you remember
where did you see the pigs
oh yes
he's just fitted in hasn't he
it's quite a fat piglet isn't it
oh right
mhm
is he going home for his tea
what's he going to have for tea
sausages
just sausages or sausages with something
do you like sausages
what are you ahhahing about
you have got two men haven't you
what're they going to do
there he is
what're you going to do with those three men
okay
that's all right
it's a very safe place to watch cars isn't it
well away well off the road aren't they up there
because they're sensible men aren't they
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
what about the other one
where is he
who's a silly
is he
why
what's he done
whoops
oh dear
did it fall off
it did didn't it
it went crash
what's what
tweeting
well what do you think it is tweeting outside
no
that's not a good idea really
oh come here
go and look at the window
what can you hear
quickly
go and look out the window
quick quick quick
what can you see
hey
don't fiddle with the blinds
how many horses
mhm
now get down off the chair
you mustn't
no
you mustn't do it again
Warren
no
you've got your sandals on
that's Nana's nice chair
choo
that's more like it
move it across a tiny bit
you see its feet
you see the monkey's feet Warren
you see they've got little holes in
you put a bobble in each little hole
it'll fit on
that's it
I'm not sure that's a good place for the monkey
or is he driving
it is
I think you might crash because the monkey's not watching where he's going
you have got your soft stuff here somewhere
well I'm not sure where it is
well do you know where it is
and I don't think it's a good idea to play with soft stuff in this room
because it's Nana's new carpet
and I'm not sure that soft stuff and new carpets go together very well
you can play with Anna's toys
you can play with soft stuff anytime
you can't play with these anytime
shall I put the panda's t on
you want him bare
oh
bare apart from his shoes
you can't get those shoes off
they're painted on
a big little bridge
that is a tiny tiny bridge
I don't think the train'll fit through that tiny tiny bridge
oh dear
no
oh
who's on that trailer
who is it on the trailer
yeah
what kind of creature is it though
do you know
can you remember
panda's having a piggy
oh
poor panda's fallen
I don't know
you look for them
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I've had a hard day Warren
all you've done is go to the dentist and go shopping
sounds like a fun day to me
but poor Mummy's been out working earning corn
who's what
the shadow
that's the plants in the garden making a shadow on the blinds
no
you can go outside later
I'll have a sleep
oh
oh you rotter
no
don't bash Mummy with toys
if you're going to bash Mummy with toys they will go straight back in the box
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well you mustn't beat people with toys
you mustn't beat people with anything in fact
you'd like a bridge
shall we mend this one and make it a little bit bigger so the train can fit through
well not quite
just just just hold your horses
that better
there we go
that's a good gate isn't it
look at all
my_goodness
there are lots_of gates here
which way is it going to go
oh the little shover
oh
the cow
I wondered what you meant by a little shover
it's called a cow
okay
that's all right
you don't have_to have it on if you don't want it
actually what
oh yes
it is because engines can push as_well_as pull can't they locomotives
so it's pushing one and pulling one isn't it now
I don't know sweetheart
you had it last
oh yes
sorry Warren
I just destroyed your tower your bridge
never mind
I shall build it again
there
that was quick wasn't it
it was Mummy trying to stick a penguin on the top
these penguins I think are really hard to put on
I always forget
ahhah
now what's that disappearing into your sock
mhm
might squeeze through just
close
do you know the penguin nearly bangs his head every time he goes through
that poor penguin
does it
no
it doesn't really fit on the back very well does it
because it gets in the way of the coupling
you put it on the front
no
it goes on those bobbles
those two knobbles
that's it
and that moves forward a bit like that
okay
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
and nice boys say please
are you a nice boy
okay
what's that hole for
is it for peeping through
is this a peeping hole
Warren peep
yeah
who made all that mess
Warren
who made all that mess
Warren made all that mess
