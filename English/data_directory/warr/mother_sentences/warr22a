I'm going to break up your other puzzles
I'm going to mix the pieces up
we've got two sets of puzzle pieces mixed up
are you going to mix that up with these as_well and have three puzzles mixed up
right
now sort out those puzzles
don't chew it please
you did chew it one time
and I've never let you forget it
there we go
it is sad
why is the kitten sad
no
she's not being silly in the garden
she's shut in the shed
she can't get out
that's right
the cat's looking out
trying to find somebody to help her
is that the right piece there
does that piece go on that puzzle or does it go on another one
it does
I think that piece you put in before must be wrong
is that piece right
I don't think that one's right
I think that one goes in another puzzle
oh yes
so it does
so what bits do you need to look for for here
oh yes
oh yes
he's got two eyes now hasn't he
one eye on one piece and one eye on another piece
you've finished that one
you've only got two more puzzles to do
and you've done half of one of them
that one's finished isn't it
you tell me what color are they
you tell me
it is yellow
you're right
you tell me
rubbish
rubbish
it's orange
it is orange
you look at that
it's orange
an orange leaf
right
where did these other pieces go
oh bless you
bless you
if you do chew that again yes you will be a naughty boy
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well you can chew it another time but that puzzle will go away
I don't think that one goes there because the cat doesn't have two heads does it
does that make a good picture
no
do you remember what goes here near the cat's bottom
his feet
and what else is in that corner
rubbish
look at the picture
rubbish
look at the picture
his feet
what's underneath that blue bit of door
what's here
can you see with a brush on
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well you look for a piece that's got bricks of the wall on it
oh dear
actually that goes in the other one
or does it
maybe it does
well look for another piece with bricks on
can you see another piece with bricks on
that does go there
it does
look look look look
that does go there
so what needs to go here
now is that the right piece
does that look right
no
so_that can't be right can it
oh dear
