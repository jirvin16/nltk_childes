shall we lift that that out
let's get some bricks
and then you can stick them on can't you
car's not gone

that's the bull
are they sleeping in the car
that's a funny place to sleep
look at this poor dolly
I bet she's cold isn't she
what's she wearing
what's poor dolly wearing

willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
of course I'll help
what would you like me to do
it is isn't it
somebody made a tower
you can't break that tower up as easily as that
you have_to do it carefully
what's gone
is it the trailer you're after
what about saying thank_you
it's a pleasure
I don't think they fit together pet
who's sleeping in the car
I think he will sit on the elephant
oh
no
it does fit if you're careful
I don't know if there's space for the fish to sleep in the car
I think a bull a cow a penguin and a chicken is quite enough to sleep in the car
if you took these out the fish would fit in I think
not stuck
what a relief
is that a weight off your mind that they're not stuck
Warren
