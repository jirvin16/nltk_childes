is she sleeping
why don't you wake her up
wake up dolly
well wake her up then
sit her up and she might open her eyes when you growl like a lion
good
oh she's asleep again
well shall I take the things out
see if we can find it
no
that's not your baby tiger
that's Anna's baby tiger
your baby tiger doesn't sit on a little bit of green grass
where Anna's baby tiger does
oh
look what I can see
who is he
is he
what color clothes is he wearing
what color clothes is he wearing
that's true actually
our postman does wear red and blue like this doesn't he
well it's red and yellow so you're half right
what are you doing to the panda
I'm not surprised
you've just spun his head right round
poor panda
I think you ought_to give him a hug and a kiss and say you're sorry first
probably break his legs putting him in that way
putting him in backwards
he needs to go in like that
poor panda
can you dins the train song
Warren sing the train song
no
Warren sing it
Warren sing it please
which train song
I don't know a horse song
you'll have_to teach it to me
she is isn't she
perhaps you should wake her up
a bull
yes
it is a bull
here's another bull I think
yes
it's another bull
yeah
that is a horse
what color is it
I think it's brown and black and white actually
there we are
worth a try
well that's a funny looking train
poor elephant gets steam and smoke up his nose
up his trunk
that's it
what is that one
what is it
it's not a toothbrush
it's a cow
I don't know
where is he
don't forget that bit
Anna's brought all these nice toys and you just want to read Bertie and the bumpy line
oh well
no accounting for taste is there
why doesn't Warren read it
www
who are his coaches
Annie and Clarabel
www
and who's waiting to take the children home
yeah
what kind of bus is Bertie
he is called Bertie
what are you called
oh
let me just attack your nose with this tissue
have you caught Mummy's cold
that is truly horrible
ugh
ugh
just don't sneeze all over me
where's Thomas now
where is he
yeah
oh
well I'm not starting right from the beginning again
right
www
is Thomas sad
well I didn't really have chance to read it the first time because you turned the pages so quickly
okay
where's Bertie
buss go on roads don't they
where do trains go
on what
tracks
that's it
or on rails
it's the same thing
tracks and rails are the same thing
and here's Thomas going along with his passengers
oh dear
he's derailed
off the line
oh no
off the rails
off the tracks
so Bertie takes his passengers while the tracks are being mended
Bertie's carrying passengers along
Thomas is sad
he thinks passengers will like Bertie better than him and the trucks think that's funny because they're nasty trucks aren't they
he's just called truck
he doesn't have a name
trucks don't have names because there are too many of them and they are not nice
trucks aren't nice things apparently
www
have they got happy smily faces
has Warren got a happy smily face
what color is it
it is just pink
you're right
I just need to get another tissue
what else can you find in the box
are you going to put this trailer on the back as_well
what've you got there
oh ah thank_you
we don't want water all over the floor
well there's nothing to look at
you look at the teddys
no
you can see the water perfectly well with the teddys in it
you look at the teddys and the baskets
I shall take it off you and put it on a high shelf
you mustn't pull that off
no
no
there's nothing to look at that's interesting
you realize something Warren
you've put this on back to front
the light is shining back into the cab
you need the light at the front of the train
if you look at Thomas and Henry the funnel is at the front of the train and the dome is towards the back
look
here's Henry
look Warren
there's his funnel and there's his dome
there's the funnel and there's the dome
they're the wrong way round
you don't really need to get your trucks out because look
you've got two trucks here with the train
whoops
well I'll play with this train then
there are strange animals on this train aren't there
well you make a tower then pet
oh dear
that's falling over a bit isn't it
oh yes
well I never
where are the other men
how many men have you got
how many
yes
there is another one isn't there somewhere
because there are three men
no
I don't think we need to tip it all out
oh
found the monkey
I can't find the other man though
ahhah
no
I think that's all the men there are
I don't know where the baby tiger's gone
is he over here
where
just where on the box
look at all these animals in here
are they jumping about
look at that
three men on bricks
if you got this long brick you could put all three men on the same brick
one two three
how many men
how many men
good boy
one two
three
three men on a brick
is he having a rest there
gosh
they're boinging very fast
the one in the middle isn't stuck on properly sweetheart
that's it
how many men
good boy
are they all boinging together
my_goodness
oh you've left one behind
look at all those animals on that train
what's the horse going to do
is it going to stand on the brick with the men
or is the man going to ride the horse
is he on
can you sing the horse song
oh dear
the cab's fallen off
that's a bit of a disaster isn't it
it's probably the monkey and the whale
who's going to drive the engine then
the giraffe's driving it
what a clever giraffe
will the giraffe drive very fast or very slow
what're you looking for
a wheel
a wheel which broke
who broke it
a wheel or a whale
I don't think you've broken any wheels recently
yeah
aren't you a lucky boy
not everybody gets to play with Anna's toys
oh that's good
it's probably safer with a man driving rather than a giraffe isn't it
who's on that truck with the giraffe
yeah
are the giraffe and penguin friends
who's the elephant's friend
yeah
who's the elephant's friend or doesn't he have any
is the train whistle blowing
what kind of noise does it make
oy
that's my foot
oh is he asleep
gosh
that's a speedy old train
oh dear
like Henry and the flying kipper
he's been derailed
because he was going too fast and missed all the points
there you go
that's mended the train
oh dear oh dear
yeah
it bumped on my toe as_well
what're you looking for
the men
the men are over there by Thomas Bertie and the bumpy line and the horse
the men are over there by the book Warren
by the book
this is gross
have you got a horrible nose
blow down your nose
that's better isn't it
yuck
yes
I think that's going straight in the bin
the sooner you learn to blow your nose the better mate
