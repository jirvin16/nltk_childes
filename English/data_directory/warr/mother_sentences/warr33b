with this yellow
well do you want to make worms again
or are you going to do some rolling out and cutting
right
okay
do it on the
shall I put the little mat back up on the table
okay
there's a little bit more yellow
there's your rolling pin
where are some shapes
hey
you're getting good at rolling out aren't you
you're being very careful though
what is that animal
what is it
do you know
what creature it is
what creature that is
it's a hippo
hip hippo
course you can
oh
the whole joblot comes out
oh

this is better stuff isn't it
it doesn't crumble as much
there
should I put a big dollop there for you
do you think that'll be enough
you can roll that out first
well roll it out with two hands
let me just
I'll hold this still
you roll it out with two hands on the rolling pin
press on a bit harder if you can
that's it
what're you going to cut out
another hippo or a different creature
oh
two hippos
one very fat hippo and one normal hippo
that one was so fat it's not even cut out is it
not properly anyway
okay
there you go
then you've got more you see for cutting out more creatures
more shapes
maybe some vehicles
is that a good idea
oh yes
well have a look in the box for a prodding stick then
excellent
that's a good old prodding stick
why don't you pick it up and turn it the other way and prod it out the way you normally do
okay
turn it the other way up and prod it out the way you normally do because that's successful isn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that'll just shove it in further
prod it out that way
that's it
do you know what hippos like doing Warren
they like lying in rivers where it's cool
because they live in very hot countrys
well come to think of it I don't think you've ever seen a hippopotamus
well they don't live generally here
what have you got
oh your favorite
what is it
you like lions don't you
yeah
you roll it out
no
turn it that way and do some more rolling
no
hold the pin that way
hold the rolling pin that way
you're not squashing this one down
use the rolling pin then it's flat
I don't know what to do with you
I tell you something
you're much better with the rolling pin than you were last time you played with this
much better
well flatter than it was
why did you bang on top
it's not naughty to bang it
why are you banging it
is it so it'll be cut out properly
it's not because you like making a horrible noise or anything
hooray
what do you need then
what
I don't think so
whose birthday is it
is it
well it is Mummy's birthday next
okay
one two
let's count
oh that was a wet blow
I wonder if Mummy's birthday cake will have candles on it this year
well I need more than three candles pet
oh no
