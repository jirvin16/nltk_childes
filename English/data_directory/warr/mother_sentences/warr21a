they're both yellow cars aren't they
have you got any more yellow vehicles you can get out
here's your yellow van
and the yellow beach buggy
and a yellow bus
and the yellow beach buggy trailer
all these yellow vehicles
and what's this
what's this coming up
and what color is it
blue
are you sure
no
it's yellow
I think that's all the yellow vehicles that we've got
yeah but the tractor's not yellow
never mind
you can have an orange tractor
get some red vehicles out now
the red fire
red train
another red fire
I've just thought of another yellow vehicle but I can't see it
look at all these vehicles parked
have they stopped at the traffic lights
right
well they'd better move off then otherwise people start going beep
in fact here comes the fire
wanting them to move
he's beeping his horn
they'd better start moving off hasn't they
no
you keep the door closed
keep the door closed
oh right
shall I move out_of the way
I'm not in the way of all your vehicles
are you making a long line
no
they can't
because that's really a baby toy
that's right
can you remember what Peter_rabbit's sisters are called
what the other little rabbits are called
they're Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail aren't they
there's a little rabbit somewhere that sits on that rabbit's back
let's have a look for it
should be in here somewhere with all the other animals and vehicles
can't see it
a
there it is
little rabbit
fits on the big rabbit
has it
where did it go on the aeroplane
a
well it's called a beach buggy
it's a special vehicle that drives on the sand
because you've got the little trailer
and there's a boat somewhere that goes on the trailer
because if you have a boat at he seaside you need to have a special vehicle that can pull it down so it can get into the sea
do you remember seeing them when we were with the girls in Kent
I don't know where the little boat is
probably in the bath
another red stop
oh the vehicles shouldn't really bump at red lights
if you keep on bumping like that the police car will come
it's a tape recorder
it is Anna's yes
what color is it
oh that police car will come with his
oh here's the boat that goes on the beach buggy
like that
and it drives down to the sea
don't keep bashing
the police car will come
at the moment I don't think it'll have a policeman in it
no
it hasn't has it
here comes the police car
nee
coming to see what's happening
yes
police cars don't bump other vehicles
you tell me
who is it
mhm
what's the big rabbit called
and what's the little rabbit called
oh it's just called rabbit is it
is it little rabbit
have they
are they
where are where are the missing rabbits
on the kitchen door
I don't think so
Mummy doesn't have rabbits there
yeah
well how many wheels has he got altogether
he's got two at the front and two at the back but how many are there altogether
because all these wheels
how many are there
that's it
because there's two at the front and two at the back
they're creaky wheels aren't they
that's a good place for him isn't it
mhm
well yeah
I would have thought it was a tractor rather than a digger
because diggers normally have scoops don't they
that's right
that's the spare wheel isn't it
in_case one of the other wheels gets broken
that's right
would you like to have a little swim in the sea
would you
maybe we can arrange it when we go on holiday
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you wouldn't go in last time we went to the sea
it wasn't cold
well a bit chilly
you wouldn't even put your toes in would you
do you remember
the water came up and you ran away screaming
it's a very long line of vehicles isn't it
are you
next time what
where are you going on the bus
where are you going on the bus
get your hand out_of your trousers
oh we've got
mhm
two lines of traffic
haven't we
we've got vehicles going in one direction and some more going in another
pardon
all these cars
what about the breakdown
you have got a crane
it's not as big as Old_Bear's crane though is it
he has
what does he do with it
yeah and what happens
and then what happens
yes
because Jolly doesn't like going up high does he
when Little_bear takes his paw off Jolly's eyes Jolly starts to wobble
that's right
and where does Little_bear go
no
he flys across the room and lands on the
yes
how does he get down
well sort of
Little_bear slides down Jolly's neck doesn't he
yeah
that's the car that used to have the caravan attached isn't it
the caravan's broken now
no
I don't know where the caravan is
it's not in here
well it's not in here anyway
what are you after
which one
I wonder where your purple beetle car is
never mind
you've got your red one haven't you
oh yes
what's that wheel for
yes
what's it doing in the bonnet
it's the spare wheel in_case one of the other wheels gets broken
do you remember when we saw that man putting a new wheel on his car
one of his wheels had broken and he had to put his spare wheel on
Mummy and Daddy have got a spare wheel in their car but it's in the boot
not in the bonnet
because beetle are special cars because their engines are at the back
yes they are aren't they
yeah
the back wheels are stuck though
what we need
well we do need a screwdriver so we can take the bottom plate off
maybe Mummy'll have a go at mending it later
no
not really
the wheels are are broken
that's right
engines are normally in bonnets
you see beetle are unusual because they have their engine at the back in the boot
well spare wheels can go in bonnets yes
some
or they can go in boots
or they can go on the back of vehicles like the Land_Rover
ow
why
I think you would say ow if a dumper truck drove over your toes
wouldn't you
yes well
they are not poorly
that's a very long line of vehicles
don't think it's big enough
I tell you what
let's get this little car out
I wonder if that little car would fit underneath
yes
let's see if I can find any more little cars
little vehicles
there's a little vehicle
we haven't got many small vehicles really
oh dear
shall the ambulance come
see if everyone's all right
nee
whoops
now that's crashed into the Land_Rover
I think the Land_Rover's probably all right
silly
that's right
where've you picked that one up
who's taught you that Warren
Charlie did he
right
it's all coming out now
oh
I shall have words with his Mother I think
I suppose it could have been worse
you want another little one

we haven't got many small vehicles you see
oh that might fit under
oh here's a small one
well here's the taxi
the taxi will fit
oh
oh I thought you meant fit under the rabbit
I don't think anything actually fixes on to the back of the breakdown truck
pass me the breakdown truck
pass it over
let me look
let's see
well it might do
if you hook it over the little thing there
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I don't think it will
I think that's very optimistic
bash it back
no
let's push it back gently
it's reversing back
now the little beetle car's coming through
brumm
turning round
going back under
oh no
they're all pushing each_other
it has broken hasn't it
why don't you mend it
oh
it has come off hasn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you'll have_to move that sports car
then you can put a sports car at the back
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
not unless you move the other vehicles backwards
that's it
look at all these vehicles
oh no
we don't want to play the music
Mummy was just moving it out_of the way
you play with your vehicles instead
I'll put he music in there for later
yeah
that's a little car against the bus isn't it
pardon
that's it
oh is it
oh dear
this is very annoying isn't it just moving forwards a little way
and having to stop again
there you go
there we go
oh I see
that cheeky engine's pushed in has he
turned in from a side road
I don't think he knows where he's going does he
well I think Harry fixed that one actually
it wasn't Granddad
Harry did fix it because it had stopped working so it couldn't make the horrible noise and Harry fixed it so it would work
so now it makes the horrible noise again
that's why we've not sent Harry a birthday present
no
I don't think they can
the doors on here open though don't they
on the Land_Rover
let's just have a look at this
oh the doors don't open
I wonder how he gets in and out
what do you mean no
oh he stays in
this one's much makes a much better noise
much more gentle isn't it
he's going to reverse back
he did didn't he
it's not really an amusing thing Warren cars bumping each_other
oh_my_goodness
well no
oh dear
that's a horrible accident isn't it
does the ambulance need to go and see if anybody's hurt
see if anyone's poorly
nee
