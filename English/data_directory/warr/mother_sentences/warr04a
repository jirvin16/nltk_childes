this one works much better because the wheels actually turn on it don't they
what kind of car's this
a broken car
why is it saying nee
what's in there
what is it
what kind of car is it
a broken car
yes it is broken because the back wheels don't work
why is the car saying nee
it doesn't look like a policecar

never mind
I don't understand the question Warren
I've never seen a policecar with a trailer Warren
and with big flood lights on the top of it
what are you on this morning Warren
I could do with some of it
yeah it is isn't it
shall we put some bricks in the scoop
what color are these bricks
yeah they're in the scoop but what color are they
they're blue bricks
and there's a red brick
where are you going to put them
yeah they're in the scoop now
are they staying in the scoop
shall we put in as many bricks as we can fit
pile in the bricks
lots_of bricks aren't there
fit one more
why don't you put the bricks in the box
oh
careful
where are the bricks
they're all over aren't they
let's put them in the box
one
two
three
good boy
no
he has_to turn round the other way
that way
whoops
well that has_to go in the long and thin way
that way
that's it
what about this blue one
that's another blue one isn't it
now look
it's a straight side there and a curved side there
you've got_to match them up
that's it
what about that one
that's an easy one
here's another one
there's a pile of bricks
that's it
hooray
the red one
there it goes
and these are all yellow bricks aren't they
where do they go
yeah but they have_to go in the thin way
that's it
the thin way
you've got it the wrong way round Warren
look at the shape
and look at the hole
Warren
look at the shape here
and look at the hole
yeah it does go in there but just look at which way round it goes
that way round
that's it
and one more
oh actually I've found two more
where does that one go
where does that yellow one go
that's it
what about those two
the green one and the yellow one
you've got that the wrong way round
you've got it
it's not too big
you've got it the wrong way round
almost
almost
just swing it round
that's it
that's a difficult one isn't it
now what about that one
do you think that is the last one
oh rubbish Warren
it doesn't go in there
where does it go
look at the shape
okay
take the lid off
tip the bricks out
okay
right
you pass me the box
I can put the lid on Warren
pass me the box
and I can put the lid on
that's it
red circle
a blue semicircle
look at the shape Warren
match it up
no
it does go in that hole
you were just holding it the wrong way
yeah
you try holding it like that and putting it in
that's it
well done
brilliant
and there's a blue circle
circles are easy aren't they
mhm
that's right
another blue circle
another blue semicircle
no
a semicircle not a circle
that's it
goes in there
brilliant
I don't think there are any more blue ones
you might have_to go for a red one
there're no more blue ones Warren
unless they're in the box
big box
put a red one in
put in a red triangle
hooray
that's right
that is another one
it's a red triangle
hooray
there's no more red triangles
there's a red square
no
that's a square
a red square
brilliant
right
there's only yellow and green ones left
that's an arch
a yellow arch
you've got it the wrong way round
that's it
brilliant
another yellow arch
another yellow arch
brill
the arches have all_gone now
we're onto rectangles
you've got a yellow rectangle
no
yes
yeah
that's a green rectangle
there's a green rectangle
what happened to that green one
that's it
all_gone
that was a nice noise wasn't it
now pass the box over and we can put this on can't we
put the lid on
thank_you
there's a blue
what's that
it's a blue circle isn't it
another blue circle
that's not a circle
that's a triangle
a red triangle
it has gone
oh
look at your nose
what did I do with that tissue
it's a race against time
blow
good boy
all_gone now
you look more respectable
it's a green rectangle
green rectangle
that's it
it was the wrong way
it's still the wrong way
yeah it was the wrong way
that's still the wrong way
you have_to make it thin like that
that's it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
ah
the green rectangle was in the way
the other one
it's a red square

that's got straight sides
that's it
a red circle
another red one
that's a red triangle
a triangle
in there
no
not in there
that's the arch
it goes in that one
the one you tried fits
if you hold it the right way round it'll go in
that's it
brilliant
there's no more red ones and there's no more triangles
you'll have_to put a yellow one or a blue one in
no
that's a blue semicircle
it doesn't go through that hole
where's the right hole
there
that's it
it is the wrong way
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
because you're holding it the wrong way
you might fit it in that way yes
maybe
no
that's the wrong way again
look
it's that way
that's it
brilliant
what about that one
put the other blue semicircle in
no that's the you've got it the wrong way round again
that's still the wrong way round
that way round
because look
you've got a straight side there and a straight side there
does it make any sense
you've done it before mate
hooray
doesn't matter
yellow arches

do you think that would be a good place for the poorly monkey to go
no
don't bash the horse
gorillas don't bash horses
gorillas don't often bash anything actually
look
the gorillas riding the horse
whee
I didn't realize the gorilla fitted on there
that's quite good isn't it
he's a very happy gorilla isn't he
well if that was a real horse it'd be fairly squashed
never mind
we saw some gorillas didn't we when we were on holiday
we did
what else did we see
and what do tigers say
what else did we see
we saw elephants didn't we
oh look
the gorilla's lifting up the horse isn't it
if you put that down on the ground it looks as though gorilla  lifting it up
because gorillas are very strong

poor thing
poor cow
knocked out
I think it is sleeping
night_night cow
can you hear the cow snoring
is the horse sleeping as_well
look
the horse is lying down
it's not a very good place for the horse to sleep is it
it's the middle of the road
that's better isn't it
no
poor horse
if the horse was bashed by a mini car it'd be more than sleeping
poor thing
put it back in the field
put it back in the field with the cows
that's it
you put it in there
it's a much nicer place for the horse to be in
whoops
it is
where's the monkey being taken
he's waving isn't he
he's saying hello Warren
are you going to wave to the monkey
see he's waving at you isn't he

oh
brilliant
oh dear
if we put the cow in that way it fits better
there we go
is the gorilla waving byebye to the cow
byebye cow
