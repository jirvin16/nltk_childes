shall we put some clothes on her
she's very cold
what a chilly doll
shall we put this dress on her
shall we thread her right arm
thread thread
and her left arm
thread thread thread
let's do her up at the back
there
that's better
she'll keep nice and warm now she's all dressed
what's that
it's not a car
it's a pretty collar
shall I put this on the on the doll
shall I put this round her neck
other way I think probably
shall we tie this round
she's got very little toes hasn't she
oh
isn't that a pretty dress
what's that
what are they
are you going to
well pull that end then if you want to take it off
undo it
no
pull these bits and then you can take it off
pull that bit
that's it
oh
a
is that a nice doll
don't know where the trailer is
oh look
what's that
yeah
here's the car
what's the monkey doing
yeah what's he doing in the car
is he driving
brumm
not a very good driver is he
Warren do it
the trailer might be under here
look at that
look at that
why did you pull the person out
did you not want somebody driving it
it's there
it's there
somebody's turned it into a car by putting by sticking bricks on it
look see
if you put this over there it's like a car
you can put people in it
or you can put penguins in it maybe
look
what's that
who's driving the car
it's a penguin
oh
penguin's got blue feet
who else is going to drive the car
shall the baby tiger drive
shall the baby tiger drive
where's the baby tiger
is he driving
what's that
that's the penguin isn't it
turn your sleeve up
I must sew that button back on
what's that
it's a whale I think
no it's not a plane
yeah
it's nice isn't it
shall the whale drive the car
look the whale's driving
who's going to drive now
well put it back on then
that's it
stick it push it back on
that's it
oh no it isn't
oh look
it's a baby whale
and what's this now
whoops
it's just fallen off
what's this
can you remember
it's the penguin
I think the penguin could go in the car with the monkey
shall we put these back in the box if you've finished with them
what's that
yes he's he's I think he's the one that  supposed to go in there
he fits in best
because that little monkey's too small
can't see over the dashboard
that's a panda
yes the trailer doesn't fit onto the car though does it
you need a special car for the trailer to fit on
oh yes
whose hat's that
whose hat is it
it's not Warren's hat
I'm sure you can borrow it
is it too big
Mummy make it not feel so big
look
what's in there
go and look at yourself
go and look at yourself in the television
see what you look like
what've you got on
what color hat
what color is it
yes Daddy does wear a hat like that on his bike
no you don't need your bike
you don't need your bike
you'll squash all Anna's toys if you bring your bike in here
willn't willn't willn't
but that is like a bike hat isn't it
when you're a bigger boy and ride your bike in the streets you'll have one
and if when you're a grown up man you work on building site you'll have_to wear one when you go to work
because these are good hats for protecting your head
in_case bricks fall on your head
or breeze blocks
or lumps of concrete from cranes
yeah the man the men working with cranes always have them
the men over the road all wear hard hats don't they
just like that one
except only one of them probably says big boss on the front
what are you making
has that come off the hat somewhere
can I see where it's come from
it's only a tiny bit
go and put it in the bin
no this bin
this bin's closer
well you've not really broken the hat
it just fell off
well it's not broken
it's just a little tiny bit that's come off
I think it's come off from there
I can see where it's from
it's come off from there
you put the hat back on
pardon
yeah
you've got it on crooked
let's put it on straight
that's better
where's the car
Warren's not going in the car today
and you're not going in Granddad's car today either
but one day Granddad will come and collect you in his car
and you can go and spend the day with Granddad and Nana
while Mummy and Daddy have a nice quiet day with no Warren
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
pardon
well you haven't broken it
so what are you making on this board
I'd forgotten how this monkey goes on
he needs to go like that
what's the monkey doing
oh pulled them all off
what's that monkey saying
what does a monkey what do monkeys say
what do monkeys say
they do don't they
oo
crash
okay put it on then
whose car
oh
is there anybody in
is anyone in
you dropped that
thank_you
you dropped that on Mummy's foot and it hurt
I'll forgive you
who couldn't forgive you when you say sorry so many times
yes you put your hat on
your Granddad's driving's not that bad that you have_to wear a crash helmet though is it
is that what you were worried about
mind you
your Nana's driving is another thing altogether isn't it
you be careful
because look
you see you're squashing the board and there was a brick under it
and then you might break it
you have_to keep the board flat when you're pressing on it
and then you can't break it
when it's flat you can press things on nicely
what
what is it
what animal is that
what is it
what's this
no it's a special kind of horse called a giraffe with a very long neck
where's Warren's neck
it's a bit tricky to get on isn't it
that's the doll's shoe
shall we put the shoe on the doll
I don't know how they go on
well maybe I can work it out
maybe you slip her foot in like that
pull the shoe
it's like a slipper isn't it
there she is
she's wearing a nice slipper
keep her feet warm
look she's got one red foot and one pink foot
what color's that foot
that's red and that's pink
what color are Warren's feet at the moment
they're red aren't they
oh poor doll
she's got bare feet now
shall we put it on
put it on her other foot
thread it through like that
there look
her toes are peeping out at the front
shall we see if we can find her other shoe
here it is
put her other shoe on
thread her foot through
get her toes out
do it up at the back
there she is
she's got two shoes on now
two slippers
nice warm feet
she's waving
hello Warren
go on
you shake hands with her
that's not a hat
where is the hat
whoops
oh that's a bit big isn't it
is that is that a bit big for the doll
a are you what are you
are you going to give her a cuddle
what do you want to take off
her shoes
we'd better not tell Daddy you've been playing with a doll had we
look you've got everything off
oh and the other shoe's off
are you threading her foot in
what are you looking for
they are like steps
like a ladder
you climbed up some steps yesterday didn't you
onto a slide
what did you crawl through when you got down to the bottom of the slide
can you remember
yeah you did go in a car
what did you crawl through when you'd gone down the slide
yeah you went whee and you crashed at the bottom
then what did you do
you crawled through a tunnel didn't you
do you remember crawling through that tunnel
yeah you climbed you crawled through it didn't you
what else did you play with at the Early Learning Centre yesterday
can you remember
you sat in a boat didn't you and rocked
what makes that noise
a
I think that's a speed boat isn't it making that much noise
the man's riding the tiger
that's a bit dangerous isn't it
what are you doing
are you tidying up
that's the last one isn't it
no more bricks
byebye bricks
who's wearing your hat
oh what if something lands on rabbit's head
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
a
you put his hat back on
that's it
oh
oh dear
tell you what
if we put his ears up inside it'll probably make it fit better
thing is these hats aren't designed really for rabbits
are they
because they're boy's and girl's hats rather than rabbit's hats
oh dear
no don't bop it on the head
don't bop poor rabbit
I think that hat's too heavy for him
I think you ought_to wear it
I know what rabbit can do
rabbit can hold the doll
look
rabbit's cuddling the doll
shall we get the doll out
oh there we go
oh look
you've undone the bow in her hair
shall we do it up again
there we go
no we don't need to do it again because it's done up
Warren do what
oh
what did you do
you undid her bow didn't you
a pretty bow
it's a red ribbon
isn't it a nice bow
nice shiny ribbon
same color as your socks
red
there we go
no not again
you're going to be a horror when you get to school
undoing ribbons on girl's plaits and ponytails
oh dear
poor rabbit
a
are you giving him a cuddle
are you patting him on the head
oh is the rabbit better now
let's put him in the clothes basket shall we
shall we try and get him in
shall we try and throw him into the basket
one two three

just just let me flatten the bottom of the basket like that
okay
sit down then
one
two
three
who's in the washing basket
you are down
you were wedged
I thought I'd be able to pull you out
you were wedged
what do we do with boys in washing baskets
we pick them up and spin them round
and then we tip them out onto the floor
tip them out
rabbit's beaten you to it
spin the rabbit round and then tip him out
that's it
that's it
now tip him out
tip him the other way
that's it
yeah tip it the other way
away from you
are you spinning the rabbit
tip him out
that's it
