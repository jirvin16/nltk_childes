now put a few little bumps in sweetheart so it's not terribly boring
okay
oh okay yeah
that's fine
it'll basically be a round one okay
go round in a square
well I'm not sure that's a good place if you want a round track
let's put it bending the other way
let's put it bending that way
right
I want a straight bit
is that all right
choo
right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you shouldn't knock the bridge down says she destroying it in the process
there we go
shall we get some
I want a I'd like a truck on my train
would you like a truck on yours
would you like a Shell_oil truck
there you go
there's your truck
what's yellow
no that
oh well
that bit underneath is yellow but that bit you were just touching is red actually
that's yellow with red writing on
oh bump
my train's stuck onto yours now
do you think
brumm
it went under the Warren bridge didn't it
oh you bumped into mine
never mind
ow
oh no
you bumped into it again
er you're in the middle of the track boy
oh no
I think my train's going to start sliding backwards
oh he can't get up the hill
oh no oh no
oh slid backwards just like what's his name
oh right
oh yes
but look who's coming
the powerful express called
bump
choo
oh Henry's half derailed
you'll have_to move
you're sitting on the track
oh dear
oh that's it
he's back on now
no
don't stand on the track sweetheart
you might break it
yes
only
you're quite right
you're quite right
even the driver doesn't normally stand on tracks does he
oh no
shall we have_to get the crane
shall we go and get the crane to lift Henry up
back on
well you just wait there while I get the crane from out here
here it is
what has your what have your Grandparents done to this crane
or what did you do to it
well I've never seen this bit coming out_of here before
right
let's pick Henry up shall we

shall we let down the hook
help to pick him up
pick up his tender first
okay
pick up his tender
put it back on
oh it's just rolled backwards
never mind
let's pick up Henry
put him on
and he can go back slowly
and collect his tender
it's handy having a crane isn't it Warren
hooray
but look
there's a rhino on the line
what shall we do
shall we lift the rhino off with the crane
plonk
I said before it's handy
oh no
that rhino's back on again
how can we get him off
okay
you get him off
oh no
the rhino's back on again
what shall we do
pick him up with the crane
well I think the crane's quite a good idea
what are you going to do with the car
oh I don't know if that's big enough to move a rhino pet
no
that's too little really
well shall we move this rhino
it is isn't it
no
we don't want him going too fast do we
well I didn't know that trains could go on roads
I thought they needed tracks to work properly
had you better move that vehicle off the track
is the crane going to get rid of the vehicle
oh I thought you'd I was hoping you would see that
never mind
I didn't hide it well enough
well I think the first thing you need to do is get rid of that vehicle off the track
it's very dangerous having vehicles
that's better
it's very dangerous having vehicles on train tracks isn't it
shall we find some more animals to go in the middle
shall we find some more animals
look what I've found
a seal and a panda
and a polar bear
you can have this weebley genie
oh he doesn't weebley very well
no
we don't kick them
well one's a panda and one's a polar bear
I know they look virtually identical
the white one is a polar bear and the black and white one is a panda
that's right
and what's the other one
a polar bear
that's it
because it lives in polar regions
north pole in fact
no
polar regions
not pigeons
just realized Warren
this weebley genie is a Disney genie
oh you'd better move those bears
poop
oh
better had
you'd better move find some way of getting rid of those bears
how shall we move them
but how are we going to move the bears
don't run over that rhino
could cause damage to the vehicle
yeah
thank_you
what shall I do with him now
I think a snoring teddy might wake him up
I think a quiet turkey might wake him up
I think a roaring lion
there he is
there you go
yeah
that's it
brilliant
he has
and he's got a very funny face
that little horn on the end of his nose
it is
and he's got a bit of a grumpy mouth
do you know anybody that looks like this Warren
that's a relief
oh be careful of those bears
those poor bears
I know what we can do
we can send someone in to rescue them
I think he'll only fit on there backwards
that way round
well it doesn't really fit on at all
oh it does
maybe he does
whoops
I've lost a truck
good job Henry's at the back pushing
good job those bears are off the track
are they
a that's nice
are they friends
oh
doesn't the polar bear like being kissed
oh
right
green go for the train
there is isn't there
and what are we going to do
shall the gorilla come and move the wall
what noise does a gorilla make
well kind of
I'm not sure actually what
come and watch the gorilla taking the wall down
big strong hand
oh
whoops
there it is
isn't he a kind gorilla
now he's standing on the track in the way
oh you want the wall
okay
it's your wall and your tunnel
you can do with it what you like
poor Mummy
that's because you blew all the air out
you sat on me hard
well the driver had better drive very carefully then hadn't he
oh he's fallen off
I'm not sure you should go on fast roads when your polar bear  not attached properly
that's better isn't it
oh yes
I don't think the gorilla's even seen the car has he
he's got his back to it
going going going going going going
oh what a surprise
now what's the gorilla going to do
okay
he's saying oy
who bumped my bottom
I think a level crossing might be a good idea for this
you could buy one with your pocket money couldn't you
so cars can drive over more easily
is it the end of the journey
it is
he's going to come and look in the tunnel
can you see him
you come round here and see if you can see the polar bear peeping over
come round this end
can you see him peeping
peekaboo peekaboo
peekaboo peekaboo
he's standing on top of the wall now
he's a very fit polar bear isn't he
he can do a_lot_of climbing
oh
jumped onto Henry's tender
I think he might fall when we go over the bridge
oh
poor bear
no
I think that's a safer way for him to travel
don't you
not very safe on the back of a train
what kind of a way to travel is that
yes
what number is Henry
no
what number
count Mummy's fingers and that's the number that Henry is
that's it
Henry's number three
and that number on his tender says three
what on earth is that Warren
what's that noise
oh right
oh it's the car engine
reversing
that's what you call going backwards in a car isn't it
reversing
where are the bears going in the car
Warren
where are they going
where are they going on holiday
oh where to
who else is going on a plane to Malta
and when are we going on the plane to Malta
yeah
Nana's coming
she's taking us to the airport
this afternoon
this time tomorrow pet you'll be eating cakes
in Malta
you will
we'll be eating cakes
Mummy'll be eating cakes as_well
oh yes
well I don't know I don't think they do cakes
well they might do cakes like that
oh I think it's Daddy
but you can stay here because Daddy's very busy this morning and doesn't want disturbing
okay
so you stay in here
you stay in here
because Daddy has got lots_of work to do this morning so you'd better not disturb him
you stay in here and we can have a little drink later with Daddy
well I'm not sure we'll be drinking outside
yes
tomorrow we'll be drinking outside
yeah
we'll be on the pavement probably drinking outside
yeah
well the sun does make the grass dry
that's right
but we haven't really got time today to be sitting outside drinking in the garden
can you get down off the chair please
what kind of bird
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
Mummy will just laugh
I will
because I've asked you to get down
do you remember when you fell off the settee and Mummy had just just asked you to get down
and you didn't and you fell off
what did Mummy do
nothing at all
I don't remember hearing you fall down the stairs
did you

no
after tomorrow we're somewhere far more exciting than Nana and Granddad
we think
no
after tea we'll be on the plane
in fact we'll have our tea on the plane
we'll eat it on the plane

she might have a cake in the car
