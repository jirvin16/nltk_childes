you've lost interest with dressing dolls
I know one person that would be pleased about that
she is a smart girl isn't she

boys don't normally wear dresses
a
is she nice
thank_you
shall she sit on here and watch you play
pardon

you don't mind her sitting on Humpty's wall do you
instead of the dress
well you undo her at the back then
okay

you need to pull it down when you're unthreading
straighten her legs out so easier to get off

Warren put it on the girl
on the doll
I know
was that a nice kiss or a horrid kiss
shall we put this blouse on her then to keep her a bit warmer
I bet she's cold at the moment with no clothes on
shall I put these trousers on Warren
shall I put the trousers on her to keep her legs warm
is that a good idea
that's a good tower
there we go
is that better
is she warm now
well that goes with something
I suppose she could wear it couldn't she
does she wear it like a bib
like that
or the other way round
I think this is what you'd call a prissy outfit
let's hope you're never responsible for dressing a female
my_goodness
stick her on your box
a
that's where her hair ribbon is
you were sitting on it
shall we put a ribbon in her hair
