that's a nice tower
yeah
you build another tower next_to it
oh dear
why don't we build a big ramp for things to slide down
if we put that up like that
things can slide down better
it's fast isn't it
look
you can do it like that
whee bop
we could make an even longer slide couldn't we
get some more
where's the other
oh there it is
you want these here
let's see if this'll
let's just try this Warren
look
I wonder if a car would work
you get a car out_of your box or your tractor
get the red tractor out_of your box and we'll try the tractor on it
shall we try letting go of the tractor up here and see what happens
oh
what happened
that's right
Warren try
it's better with this isn't it
that rolls better
make everything lined up
let's line things up nicely and straight
here we go
what's too big
the what
you did bash didn't you
that was a very loud bash
have we got another one like this somewhere
we should have
are we sure we want loud bangs at this time of day
it's turning over isn't it
well find a smaller vehicle then that isn't too big
straighten them up
because they're not straight are they
straighten them up
like this
nice and straight
you've moved the ramp
put the ramp back
is it
shall we have a little ramp
here's a little ramp
you like running up and down ramps don't you
oh
whee
why doesn't Warren do it
just
all you have_to do is put it there and let go
mhm
yeah
it went backwards and forwards didn't it
backwards and forwards
backwards forwards
backwards forwards
backwards forwards
it makes a little clicking sound as_well
yeah
you're good at that now aren't you
whoops
flew off
oh dear
crash
shall we build an arch for the tractor to drive through
oh dear
tractor's crashed
not surprised really because there's no driver in it
where's the driver for the tractor
where's the driver
what's broken
that's the Spot jigsaw isn't it
shall we find the rest of it so we can mend it
oh_my_goodness
oh there's some more of Spot
see if you can fit fit those together
wonder where the rest of him is
he's probably right at the bottom
there's another bit
and there's one more piece somewhere
here it is
shall we try and put the picture together
where's the other piece
are you sitting on it
ahhah
there it is
right
where's Spot's eyes
Spot's eyes are closed
can you see them
there's Spot's eyes
look
there's his tongue and his paws
now can you put these pieces on
no
that's not right
that one's not right there
look at the basket
try and finish off the front of the basket
that's it
and there's Spot's tail wagging
this is hard
you've got_to get the two things matched up
hold it by the edge
hold it here
drop it on
that's it
hooray
and there's Spot in his basket
with a bone
what's Spot doing
how do you know he's sleeping
his eyes are shut aren't they
mind you
if his tail's wagging he might not be asleep
shall we take it apart and put it back together again
can Warren put it back together again

Mummy can draw a broken down car but she can't draw a plane I don't think
