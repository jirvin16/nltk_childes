it's a lizard
what shape's inside there
what do you think
well we can't really
we'll have_to reroll it
now can you make sure that you don't drop the balls on the carpet
yeah well go and squash it over the mat
I think you've squashed it
you destroyed it
poor wheel
never mind
we can always make another one can't we
that's the thing about soft stuff
if you destroy something it doesn't matter
nothing
what's inside it
you squeeze it
ow
my finger
just picking up bits off the floor Warren
they keep dropping down
well that'll just disappear
no
we'll save the pink one until we've finished with the yellow
do you want to cut some more yellow shapes out
they were all spoilt

what are you going to cut out_of that
you make whatever you like
I really don't mind
sorry
I don't quite understand what you mean
want a train the back another bus
oh hang on
I think I see
right
let's have a let's have a think how we can do this
no
well it looks like a snake
now just keep that cutter off please
yeah
that's what I'm trying to do
just a second
right
what we can do you see
we can put the train at this end
and we can put lots_of these like coaches afterwards can't we
there we go
and a coupling
yeah
well we've not really got enough soft stuff have we
well there isn't the space on the mat for it
that's another problem you see
those carriages
three carriages so far
okay
there's the engine
brilliant
that's fitted on perfectly hasn't it
oh yes
it's all right
the answerphone's on
how many windows are there

put all these together
just a moment
hold your horses
just wait
right
put the lizard on
and very carefully
that's good isn't it
