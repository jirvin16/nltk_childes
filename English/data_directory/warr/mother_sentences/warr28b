I don't know
you look for it
tell you what
we'll put these away then we don't think that they're Anna's
put them on that chair then they don't get mixed up
is that a good idea
shall we move the doll and her clothes over here
do you want the doll
she's going to watch
right
shall I put her over here so she can watch
shall she watch the loudspeaker
there we go
whoops
there
she's watching the loudspeaker and your books
what're you making
what're you making
are you making a tower or a bridge
or a house
or a ship
or a boat
or an aeroplane
what're you making
a small big tower
wow
that's good isn't it
it certainly is isn't it
whoo
crash
oh dear
shall we put that on like that
oh
there you go
what color's that brick
that one
what color is it
is it
that's a funny sort of red
a yellowy kind of red
that's yellow isn't it
which is the funny carriage
Warren
where's the funny carriage
oh fill the carriage
sorry
I thought you said funny carriage
gosh
it is isn't it
right
so your tower's getting smaller and the pile of stuff in your trailer's getting bigger isn't it
I think it might
that's it
there we go
that's really big
that is a really tall pile of bricks on your trailer truck
where are they going to go
that is a funny train
you've got bits missing off that
here's the dome and the funnel
shall we find the cow
ahhah
shall we make the train
I don't know where the driver is
you keep your eyes peeled for him
do you want to put the cab on
then you can find the driver and put him in
where is the driver
hadn't you better find the driver
do you want me to look for a driver
yes please
is it the driver with legs that goes in here
which hand
there he is
he was late this morning wasn't he for his train
oh dear
it's like Henry and the flying kipper derailed
oh no
look at that
disaster
well press it down properly then it's fixed okay
might be a bit stronger in there
okay
there's one man
can you see any more men
well keep looking because they'll be in there
I can see one
oh no
I can't
it's the baby tiger that I can see
both peeping in together trying to look for men
right
you just wait there
I don't know
you stay here and play with the bricks while Mummy goes and sees who it is
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I think it might be Nana and Granddad
it's some people that you're going to see later
some people who are going to eat their tea in our dining room
in the bomb site
oh did I tread on your foot pet
I'm sorry
I normally take my shoes off don't I
shall I kiss it
your foot's better now
look at you with your trousers falling off
I'm sure that used to squeak
hey
that makes a good noise doesn't it
the car going over that
can you see the bits of gate
there we go
is that to keep animals in or out
no
it can't can it
I haven't taken these bricks from any of your things Warren
I've just taken them from where they were
sitting by my knee
it's interesting peeping because you see the reflections in the bricks
excuse you
Warren
what's what
oh yes
oh yes
that's a bull
a Daddy cow
there's a bull and a cow
a bull is like a Daddy cow and a cow is like a Mummy cow
and a Warren cow is a calf
that's the baby cow
the little boy cow
no
that's a horse dear
let's look for a baby cow
I don't know if there is a baby cow actually
is that a baby cow
no
it's a sheepdog
not much difference
I can't find a baby cow
maybe there isn't one
oh you've got a goat
course it can
remember the monkey has_to stand on its feet
push its feet on
it bends over with its bottom stuck up in the air
look
you have_to put it on like that
I think
there you go
what's the monkey saying as the train drives along
whoops
oh look at that
what shall we do
I think that's a bit of a high load
perhaps you ought_to spread it out and have some on one truck and some on another
rather than it all being on one truck
I think there are only two
well you can use your trailer but you must remember that it's your trailer and not Anna's
all right
otherwise Anna will take it home
shall we remember that that's yours
look at that
that's a long train isn't it
right
how many trailers have you got
rubbish
how many have you got
three trailers
that's right
and one engine
it is isn't it
those are very high
crumbs
I hope they don't come to a low bridge
I don't think I can make a bridge high enough
let's have a go
let's try making a very high bridge
can you pass me some more bricks please
that's because you're not looking for them
we've got_to try and make this bridge big enough for that train to go through haven't we
hey ho
if you do it mate you'll wreck it
are they the same height
no
they're not
silly Mummy
it helps if they're the same height doesn't it
right
will the engine fit through
well the engine will but will the trailer fit through though
you think so
shall the baby tiger sit on top and just check
Warren
I've made an especially high bridge for your especially high load and now you've got a low load
never mind
you've got a giraffe watching as_well
you've lost that trailer
well put it back on then
beep
open the gates
hey
it's crashed into my leg
you need the gates sorry at the same height
that would make them the same height
which one
oh they can fit under the gates
oh that's handy
high up gates and low down gates
poop
oh I see
well you just knocked it off
no
why don't you put that high up with the other blue gate
that's it
shall I turn it round so it can drive back
poop
oh no
it's come off
you can't run the horse over now look
it's stuck behind the gate
when the gate opens it'll protect the horse
shall I wipe its eyes
Warren
can I do anything right
you're a dreadful child Warren
well what does that gate do up there Warren
what's it doing
it's peeping
I don't think gates are supposed to peep
I thought gates were supposed to keep things out or things in
well it'll fit through if the train's not there
right
the tiger'll come and open the gates
shall I go and sit in the kitchen Warren
oh
you rotter
what did you just say
I'm not being horrid
who's being horrid
why am I being horrid
I think I'm lovely
oh okay
horrid Warren
are you horrid
Warren
are you horrid
oh Warren
let's make your bridge again
you want to make a little bridge
you want a smaller bridge than the last one
okay
now where's the other
ah

which
that one
is that bridge better
what's that horse doing
jumpy jumping
who's driving that car
shall we put nothing in it
ah
some bricks are driving it
okay
shall I put it back on
there we go
what's the car going to do
oh
that's exciting what's inside that car
three bricks
a yellow one and black one and a green one
are they
what's not going
Anna's going quite soon
well you weren't playing with them
Warren
you are perverse
yeah
he is
beep
what does the car go
what does the car say then
what do elephants say
they say jumpy jumpy on the side
no
it can't can it
it'll have_to move the animals
that's true
we don't want the elephant being run over
it might damage the car
is it
oh dear
what's happened to it
oh is this a breakdown train

it's terrible
I'm not sure that shoving it is the best option actually
oh yes
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
what's on that little bit
