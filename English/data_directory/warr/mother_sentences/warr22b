what're you making
okay
is it going to have a high high wall round it
just a little one

where are the people going on the train
of course
where's it going now
right
excellent
so you are
my_goodness
well there's a little gap and you haven't got a piece small enough to fit it
that's right
that's a good idea
two green ones together
what color's that one
yeah
that's right
are you going to put the blue one next_to the other blue one
two blue ones together
well put it on top of the other blue one then
you put it wherever you like
oh yes
it's gone round a corner hasn't it
those two blue ones
oh she's sleeping isn't she
what color are those pieces
what color are they
well it would actually
well it fit more easily there doesn't it
oh look
well you can always put it on here
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you can stick it on there
on top
there we go
you're getting a nice long train now
which man
oh yes
talking about what
oh they're talking about a race
who's in the race
oh right
excellent
is he firing water at me
oh I'm all wet
have_to dry myself off
oh no oh no
I'll wipe you with this one
get all the water on
shall I wipe it off again
I don't think he'll put any more water on you
oh no
let's wipe Warren
oh no
I'm wet
we're all dripping wet
wipe it off
oh elephant
you naughty elephant
elephant
just come here
elephant
come here
now you listen to me
you don't normally squirt people with water in the house
okay
do it outside please
he'll do it outside in future so it doesn't matter if we get wet
okay
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you naughty elephant
you promised
you promised me that you wouldn't do it again
the naughty elephant
well no
because it's a bit cold for elephants outside today
no more squirting
no more squirting
no
you don't need another tissue pet
borrow Mummy's
you did didn't you
you were a good boy when you played with those in the car this time
not like the first time when you pulled the plug out_of the bottom and the water came out
we had to screech to a halt didn't we then Warren
with water pouring everywhere
how many teddys have you got in
you just need to get one more in don't you
who's poorly
why
oh
do you want a cuddle
why are you sad
oh
you bashed your head on those teddys
well that was a daft thing to do wasn't it
poor Warren
oh
you want to go to bed
well you can't go to bed
it's not bed time
it's not bed time until you've had your lunch and your tea and your bath
and who's bathing Warren tonight
and
who's going to lift Warren out
Daddy's not bathed you for ages has he
you haven't got a pocket in those trousers pet
no
you haven't got any pockets
on some of your other trousers yes you have got pockets
but you've got no pockets in those
okay
so it is
can you throw it to Mummy
hooray
Mummy throw it to Warren
whee
that's the only kind of ball we can throw inside
one made out_of tissue
throw it to Mummy
oh
why don't we put it up your sleeve
and if you need it you've got a tissue there haven't you
and Mummy can forget about it and put it through the washing machine
everything'll come out with white fluff on it
is that a good idea
oh
no
no kicking in the house
not even tissue balls
oh
oh
you're not very accurate
Warren catch
going going going going going going going going
oh Mummy's a bad shot
you'll never be in the Olympic team
whoops
never mind
just leave it
there
you put it back on there
that's it
yes
I caught it
hooray
you're very bouncy all of a sudden child
is it that bang on the head
no
don't bang Mummy on the head
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
if you're going to bang my head deliberately with yours I'm not having you on my knee
that was silly
pardon
what's that funny whinie noise
you don't know
I think it a little whinie boy
a
what's the matter
what's the matter
what do you think
a tissue
we all fall down
stop it
no
don't you dare
if you bang my head again with yours you will be in trouble
yes you will
yes
yes
now that's far more sensible than banging Mummy's head
I think that might fit in it
let's have a look
will it fit in
that's it
now you've got all these little gaps and I don't think there  anything that'll fit in there
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
we'll have_to leave them
it is like a h for Harry
actually I think that might fit on somewhere
let Mummy have a can Mummy have a try
try fitting in over there
no
over here
there
that fits doesn't it
what're you doing
you're taste
but Little_bear's porridge was just right
he didn't have_to blow on Little_bear's porridge
it was Daddy_bear's porridge that you had to blow on because it was too hot wasn't it
or have I got it wrong
oh yes
you sort those little corners out
well shall we put the
you see the thing is these little blobby bits have_to go on the monkey's feet here
okay
or he can sit on the smoke stack
if we stand him there
okay
he can only stand somewhere like that you see
is he filling up the tender with the water
what a helpful elephant

where Mummy and Daddy drive very slowly
