right
I
want
a
there
is
a
bumpy
road
oh
thank_you
sweetheart
I
shall
make
this
bumpy
road
a
bit
longer
well
that
is
rather
an
inconvenient
shaped
piece
to
put
in
actually
there
you
go
one
bumpy
road
we
will
leave
those
pieces
out
we
do
not
need
those
in
at
the
moment
or
is
that
going
to
cause
great
traumas
ah
ah
put
this
one
up
here
is
that
better
with
all
the
pieces
in
I
will
build
er
Warren
the
train
is
supposed
to
go
on
the
track
shall
we
put
some
carriages
together
how
many
how
many
carriages
shall
we
put
on
just
keep
it
in
the
track
it
is
much
easier
says
she
now
derailing
it
reverse
beep
is
it
stuck
back
on
oh
you
do
not
need
to
push
it
from
the
back
if
you
pull
it
from
the
front
that
is
it
oh
the
train's
getting
longer
brilliant
shall
we
make
a
tunnel
do
you
want
a
tunnel
we
could
make
Henry's
tunnel
right
let
us
get
some
bricks
out
to
make
Henry's
tunnel
I
thought
we
I
thought
we
were
making
Henry's
tunnel
pet
here
is
Henry's
tunnel
the
problem
is
you
see
we
have
not
got
enough
track
to
do
two
two
tracks
so
this
train's
going
to
get
stuck
in
Henry's
tunnel
it
goes
round
he
will
get
into
Henry's
tunnel
and
he
cannot
come
out
oh
no
oh
no
oh
yes
it
can
never
mind
we
can
make
that
a
decoration
for
the
top
of
the
tunnel
hey
we
could
pretend
it
was
a
train
with
a
snowplow
on
the
front
that
looks
like
a
snowplow
does
not
it
oh
that
is
an
alternative
use
of
my
tunnel
see
we
will
put
the
the
bits
across
the
top
the
bigger
bits
no
that
bit's
not
going
on
there
these
bits
across
well
I
have
never
seen
a
carriage
pulling
a
train
before
no
it
cannot
go
in
because
Henry's
tunnel's
got
a
wall
built
across
it
has
not
it
you
could
always
move
the
wall
from
the
front
you
could
always
move
the
wall
the
wrong
wheels
no
they
are
the
right
wheels
er
I
think
you
have
lost
some
of
your
coaches
Warren
yeah
you
did
bash
Henry's
tunnel
why
did
you
sound
surprised
Warren
build
Henry's
tunnel
I
do
not
see
why
I
should
keep
building
a
tunnel
if
you
just
keep
bashing
it
down
Warren
make
it
let
us
put
those
two
close
together
then
you
can
make
Henry's
no
put
it
the
other
way
round
no
put
it
long
put
it
crossways
like
that
that
one
can
go
up
there
yes
is
that
a
decoration
for
Henry's
tunnel
well
this
is
going
to
be
a
wild
tunnel
is
not
it
do
not
push
them
all
under
the
chair
because
we
might
not
be
able
to
get
them
out
and
you
have
pushed
one
of
the
best
pardon
well
I
will
see
what
I
can
do
no
do
not
bang
do
not
shove
them
under
any
more
it
is
amazing
what
we
find
under
these
is
not
it
there
is
one
no
do
not
keep
pushing
them
back
under
if
you
push
them
back
under
again
I
am
not
getting
them
out
again
I
do
not
mind
getting
them
out
once
I
cannot
reach
any
more
I
will
make
Henry's
tunnel
mind
the
cups
of
tea
pet
shall
we
make
a
fancy
tunnel
make
a
fancy
tunnel
where
are
you
going
Daddy's
gone
out
oh
your
nose
is
disgusting
child
Daddy's
gone
out
oh
gross
you
just
whip
your
fingers
in
there
and
it
is
horrible
horrible
have
you
seen
that
fancy
tunnel
with
all
those
fancy
bricks
on
it
look
well
it
does
look
a
bit
like
a
castle
would
you
like
Mummy
to
build
a
tunnel
mhm
I
am
not
quite
sure
how
you
build
a
castle
oh
that
train
is
really
a
bit
too
long
I
do
not
think
there
are
any
coaches
missing
count
them
you
missed
out
this
well
that
is
not
a
coach
is
it
that
is
an
engine

have
got
two
engines
and
four
coaches

that
is
how
many
you
should
have
oh

it
is
air
two
thousand
possible

was
a
white
plane
with
a
red
it
is
just
gone
let
us
have
a
look
no
it
is
just
gone
behind
those
trees
just
missed

probably
be
another
one
soon
people
going
off
