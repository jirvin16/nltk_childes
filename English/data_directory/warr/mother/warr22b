all
of
a
sudden
child
is
it
that
bang
on
the
head
no
do
not
bang
Mummy
on
the
head
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not

will
not
if
you
are
going
to
bang
my
head
deliberately
with
yours
I
am
not
having
you
on
my
knee
that
was
silly
pardon
what
is
that
funny
whinie
noise
you
do
not
know
I
think
it
a
little
whinie
boy
a
what
is
the
matter
what
is
the
matter
what
do
you
think
a
tissue
we

you
bang
my
head
again
with
yours
you
will
be
in
trouble
yes
you
will
yes
yes
now
that
is
far
more
sensible
than
banging
Mummy's
head

think
that
might
fit
in
it
let
us
have
a
look
will
it
fit
in
