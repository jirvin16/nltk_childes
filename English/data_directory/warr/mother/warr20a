a
for

a
for

Warren
because
it
spoils
it
a
bit
let
us
just
wipe
it

it
off
a
bit
I
am
making
a
pattern
I
have
got
flowers
round
the
outside

up
the
middle
I
will
do
some
hearts
there
do
you

my
pattern
why
do
not
you
do
a
pattern
take
that
out_of
your
mouth
I
do
not
want
wet
dribble
and
slobber
all
over
it

it
spoils
it
no
