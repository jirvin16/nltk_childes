as
broken
down
Land_Rover

the
chappie
going
to
come
out
and
mend
it
what
is
he
going
to
do
to
mend
it
do
you
think
pardon
oh
put
it
on
the
break
on
there
right
will
it
fit
on
there
yeah
it
might
do
why
do
not
you
try
that
is
right
shall
we
see
if
the
Land_Rover
can
drive
up
onto
here
then
reversing
off
oh
it
kind
of
stays
on
there
does
not
it
it
is
a
bit
big
really
has
it
been
taken
away
to
be
mended
could
this
man
not
mend
it
a
broken
down
lady
let
us
have
a
look
for
a
broken
down
lady
I
do
not
know
if
you
have
got
a
broken
down
lady
actually
have
you
oh

this
the
broken
down
lady
Warren

fit
in
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
shall
we
get
her
out
do
not
lean
on
the
top
because
it
might
just
break
the
transporter
oh
she
does
not
want
to
come
out
does
she
she
is
waving
goodbye
to
the
Land_Rover
I
think
what
is
wrong
with
the
Land_Rover
what
bit's
broken
what
needs
mending
oh
right
is
there
a
hole
in
the
wheel
right
why
not
whoops
oh
is
it
a
sleepy
horse
that
is
a
good
place
for
a
sleep
is
not
it
away
from
all
the
noisy
vehicles
except
the
noisy
rhino's
going
to
come
and
wake
the
horse
up
is
it
not
oh
right
is
it
going
to
be
a
quiet
rhino
tiptoeing
past
okay
tiptoe
that
is
a
funny
place
for
a
rhinoceros
well
what
is
it
then
okay
I
was
just
sort
of
holding
it
I
was
not
intending
to
put
it
on
the
car
transporter
tiger
actually
grr
shocker
do
not
know
where
you
picked
that
up
from
no
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
he
is
too
small
too
big
yeah
the
baby
tiger
would
certainly
fit
on
there
but
I
do
not
know
where
the
baby
tigers
are
did
the
baby
tigers
go
on
holiday
with
us
I
think
they
did
did
not
they
oh
yeah
that
should
not
be
in
your
vehicle
box
should
it
my_goodness
do
not
have
irons
in
the
vehicle
box
now
what
is
happened
to
this
bus
that
is
better
yes
what
is
wrong
with
them
sitting
on
the
bench
they
are
having
a
little
rest
because
they
have
been
working
hard
mending
cars
all
morning
oh
right
yes
okay
next_to
the
horse
what
about
the
little
girl
the
ice
lady
where
is
she
going
to
go
do
they
not
no
oh
they
do
no
they
do
not
where
is
the
little
girl
no
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
never
mind
well
she
could
sit
on
the
grass
could
not
she
that
green
bit
there
looks
like
grass
does
not
it
she
could
sit
there
and
eat
her
ice
well
she
is
got
a
picture
of
an
ice
on
her
jumper
has
not
she
it
might
be
magic
ice
a
magic
picture
on
her
jumper
oh
that
was
clever
they
have
gone
under
the
settee
now
no
because
they
have
gone
right
to
the
wall
at
the
back
I
can
see
something
peeping
out
I
can
see
your
motorbike
under
the
settee
you
can
probably
reach
no
I
cannot
reach
them
because
they
are
right
at
the
back
of
the
settee
well
you
cannot
have
them
darling
because
you
have
pushed
them
under
the
settee
you
could
have
a
coast
man
get
his
helicopter
out
he
could
go
and
rescue
some
people
where
are
the
rotor
yeah
here
you
go
because
coast
go
out
and
rescue
people
who
are
stuck
on
boats
in
the
sea
it
is
is
not
it
he
is
going
to
jump
into
this
helicopter
quickly
so
it
does
not
get
him
why
do
not
you
stop
the
rotor
while
he
climbs
in
that
is
it
then
he
can
go
off
and
rescue
some
people
mhm
that
is
a
good
idea
to
take
the
rotor
off
yeah
that
is
a
good
idea
who
is
he
going
to
go
and
rescue
oh
oh
right
he
is
just
checking
that
everything's
working
like
those
ambulance
people
we
saw
the
other
day
oh_my_goodness
I
hope
he
is
not
hurt
the
ambulance
came
just
in_case
he
was
hurt
and
had
to
go
to
hospital
well
that
was
a
beautiful
spin
was
not
it
that
span
really
well
whoops
well
it
is
really
is
not
it
it
looks
like
there
is
been
a
big
accident
if
you
put
everything
standing
up
it
will
just
look
as_if
they
are
parked
rather
than
crashed
the
key
should
be
in
here
somewhere
so
we
can
wind
it
up
but
I
do
not
know
where
there
it
is
what
is
the
matter
right
now
you
have_to
hold
it
down
like
that
and
keep
the
wheels
still
while
you
turn
it
no
wrong
way
turn
it
that
way
towards
the
front
of
the
engine
right
are
you
going
to
let
go
that
is
Bertie
I
think
I
am
sitting
on
Thomas
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
you
will
have_to
wind
him
up
again
well
you
have_to
make
sure
the
wheels
are
on
the
ground
right

not
it
send
it
back
right
okay
it
is
a
bit
keen
to
go

not
it
a
bit
like
Thomas
when
he
goes
out_of
the
station
so
quickly
that
he
leaves
his
guard
behind
does
not
he
when
he
leaves
his
guard
behind
