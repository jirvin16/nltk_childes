well
actually
those
bits
do
not
go
together
right
now
then
let
us
have
a
look
at
these
pieces
get
them
all
the
right
side
up
right
let
us
look
at
that
one
Warren
that
one's
got
some
red
ball
on
it
with
white
spots
can
you
find
another
piece
with
red
on
it
color
like
that
red
color
can
you
find
another
piece
another
piece
with
red
on
it
no
that
is
not
red
that
is
brown
that
does
not
go
there
does
it
there
must
be
another
piece
with
red
on
a
there
it
is
there
right
now
we
have
got
the
ball
have
not
we
and
look
there
is
the
puppy's
leg
look
we
are
starting
to
get
the
puppy's
head
now
oh
yes
which
bit
of
the
puppy
is
that
what
are
these
those
are
his
eyes
be
not
they
so
this
is
the
other
puppy
is
not
it
can
we
find
some
more
bits
of
this
puppy
can
you
find
the
puppy's
nose
you
find
the
puppy's
nose
can
you
find
a
black
nose
yeah
so_that
piece
fits
on
there
do
you
want
to
put
it
on
just
there
Warren
do
it
that
is
it
brilliant
now
then
what
do
we
need
that
bit
goes
there
that
is
it
and
that
bit
goes
there
where
does
that
piece
go
oh
yes
well
I
think
that
goes
there
maybe
brilliant
there
it
goes
I
have
got
two
bits
these
need
to
fit
together
at
some
point
right
what
about
that
piece
yeah
what
about
that
piece
no
it
is
got
a
bit
of
a
flower
at
the
bottom
where
are
the
flowers
that
is
it
brilliant
well
look
now
this
has
got
a
straight
edge
so_that
has_to
go
along
an
edge
somewhere
I
think
that
might
go
there
there
it
goes
and
where
do
you
think
this
bit
goes
whoops
that
is
right
that
bit
goes
just
there
so
we
need
a
piece
to
fit
this
hole
can
you
see
a
piece
like
that
other
way
round
other
way
up
you
match
the
white
bit
with
the
white
fur
and
the
brown
bit
with
the
brown
fur
that
is
it
now
we
are
left
with
these
two
pieces
where
do
they
go
does
that
fit
does
that
fit
I
do
not
think
it
does
what
about
trying
it
here
hooray
so
where
does
that
bit
go
look
now
this
has
got
a
straight
edge
has
not
it
and
that
has_to
go
along
there
so
where
does
the
piece
go
that
is
it
brilliant
two
puppys
and
a
ball
in
the
garden
with
flowers
you
want
to
put
it
away
you
do
not
want
to
do
it
again
shall
we
get
that
kitten
out
now
are
you
going
to
chew
the
pieces
like
you
did
last
time
do
you
remember
the
last
time
you
played
with
it
ages
ago
we
had
to
put
it
up
on
the
bookshelf
because
you
were
chewing
it
and
spoilt
it
and
there
are
big
gaps
where
there
should
not
be
I
do
not
know
why
I
am
bothering
because
it
always
falls
apart
when
I
put
it
in
but
never
mind
slide
in
we
will
find
that
kitten
there
is
only
one
kitten

goes
there
I
am
getting
through
this
one
I
can
see
a
brick
wall
that
is
why
I
could
not
work
it
out
because
the
blue

you

that
bit
goes
there
that
bit
goes
oh

is
not
missing

me
being
daft

Warren

that
one
I
can
see
you
through
it
can
you
see
Mummy
through
the
puzzle
we
will
put
that
one
away
for
the
minute
and
we
will
put
that
one
away
for
the
minute
get
those
out
later
right
can
you
do
this
puzzle
take
it
apart
and
if
you
chew
it
it
goes
away
again
no
do
not
chew
it
please
right
there
is
the
dog's
body
where
is
the
dog's
head
where
is
the
dog's
head
well
fit
it
onto
the
body
then
er
there
is
the
front
of
his
body
with
his
front
leg
that
is
it
good
boy
now
where
is
the
dog's
ear
where
is
the
dog's
ear
and
his
eye
and
part
of
a
blue
ball
there
is
one
eye
where
is
his
other
eye
and
his
ear
okay
no
that
one
does
go
there
you
just
tried
putting
it
in
the
wrong
way
round
now
look
there
is
a
hole
there
which
that
sticky
out
bit
goes
in
that
is
it
hooray
now
where
is
the
dog's
back
leg
no
there
is
another
piece
before
that
because
look
part
of
the
cat's
face
is
missing
can
you
find
the
other
bit
of
the
cat's
face
yeah
so
those
two
go
together
that
is
it
and
then
that
bit
goes
on
here
to
finish
off
the
dog's
other
ear
and
his
back
no
look
at
the
shape
of
the
pieces
look
there
is
a
gap
there
for
a
sticky
out
bit
to
go
in
that
is
it
now
there
is
one
piece
left
where
does
that
go
is
that
finished
and
what
is
happening
on
that
picture
where
is
the
cat
in
the
window
that
is
right
the
cat's
stuck
in
the
shed
I
think
and
she
is
meowing
to
try
and
get
out
are
you
going
to
put
it
in
there
thank_you
shall
we
do
another
one
now
break
this
one
up
it
is
only
got
one
piece
chewed
out_of
it
look
chewed
piece
right
where
are
you
going
to
start
yeah
can
you
find
another
bit
with
blue
on
it
that
is
the
cat's
ear
I
think
no
because
the
cat's
eye
has_to
go
there
can
you
find
the
cat's
other
ear
there
is
one
ear
there
where
the
cat's
other
ear
yes
that
is
a
brush
but
where
is
the
cat's
other
ear
where
is
the
cat's
other
ear
there
is
one
ear
there
where
is
the
cat's
other
ear
that
is
right
and
ears
go
next_to
each_other
so
where
must
that
ear
go
hooray
yes
that
must
go
there
no
find
a
there
is
a
piece
here
Warren
with
blue
on
it
that
is
it
that
is
the
cat's
tail
is
not
it
sticking
up
now
there
is
two
pieces
left
where
do
they
go
but
Warren
that
is
got
blue
it
must
be
a
blue
bit
that
goes
there
that
is
not
blue
that
is
grey
well
I
suppose
it
is
a
kind
of
pinkie
color
and
does
that
go
there
Warren
does
that
look
right
yes
hooray
so
where
must
that
go
and
why
does
that
look
funny
oh
is
it
because
somebody's
chewed
a
piece
out
are
you
going
to
put
it
in
there
then
we
can
do
the
last
one
which
has
got
lots_of
holes
in
one
more
look
at
all
the
holes
in
this
one
this
is
where
the
kitten
comes
out_of
the
shed
mix
the
pieces
up
can
you
find
bits
that
go
together
you
see
the
dog's
ears
be
not
you
going
to
do
this
puzzle
is
it
too
hard
yeah
it
is
not
too
hard
is
it
no
that
must
not
go
there
look
well
there
is
the
cat's
face
where
is
the
cat's
body
where
is
the
cat's
body
it
is
not
a
nappie
it
is
a
bit
of
white
fur
in
the
cat's
chest
cats
do
not
wear
nappies
because
cats
are
grown
up
creatures
they
know
where
to
do
things
unlike
somebody
shall
Mummy
do
this
one
where
does
it
go
no
you
were
trying
to
put
it
in
the
right
place
you
were
just
being
no
that
does
go
there
and
where
do
these
two
pieces
go
turn
it
round
that
is
it
turn
it
round
because
you
have
got_to
have
blue
on
this
side
of
it
have
not
you
you
need
to
look
at
the
colors
as_well_as
the
shapes
that
is
it
brilliant
okay
you
put
them
in
there
another
one
I
do
not
think
we
have
got
any
more
which
other
one
we
have
not
got
any
more
up
there
have
not
got
any
more
because
the
er
fire
one
has
disappeared
I
wonder
where
on
earth
it
is
yes
that
was
underneath
the
er
chair
that
is
why
it
was
on
the
floor
because
it
was
under
the
chair
why
do
not
you
do
one
of
these
another
one
of
these
again
yes
are
you
reading
a
story
what
does
it
say
right
which
one
are
you
doing
first
which
one
are
you
going
to
do
first
there
is
three
puzzles
which
one
are
you
doing
first
okay
no
put
that
back
in
then
it
is
easier
when
we
want
to
do
it
again
when
you
want
to
do
it
again
yes
that
one
comes
apart
easily
does
not
it
why
is
it
coming
apart
easily
because
somebody's
chewed
all
the
bits
off
this
was
a
Christmas
present
from
Father_Christmas
was
not
it
and
you
have
chewed

what
is
he
what
is
he
doing
did
he
open
the
door

let
the
kitten

the
shed
mhm
because
the

was
stuck
in
the
shed
was
not
she
she
could
not
open
the
door
and
there
she
is
peeping
out

so
the

then
the
puppy
comes
and
opens
the

you

help
Mummy

Percy
let

and
Percy
right
can
you
see
Percy's
face
where
is
Percy's
face

Percy's
boiler
okay
so
those
bits
must
go
together
must
not
they
hooray
now
who

next_to
Percy
right
so
Thomas's
face
needs

got
a
short
no
that
is
the
steam
from
his

up
here
that
piece
goes
above
here
see
Percy's
funnel
at
the
bottom

of
Percy's
funnel
now
we
need
the

Thomas's
funnel

his

where
are
Thomas's

do
not
sit
on
my
knees
oh
look
there
are
two
birds
on
the
nuts
the
call
of
the
red
engine
well
we
started
this
story
before
did
not
we
we
were
reading
it
when
the
doorbell
went
remember
James
lets
off
steam
and
he
blows
off
the
Fat_Controller's
top
hat
oh
no
he
does
not
blow
it
off
he
gets
water
all
over
it
that
is
right
who
is
James
pulling
the
train
with
that
is
right
so
how
many
engines
are
pulling
it
how
many
engines
are
pulling
the
train
there
is
two
one
two
is
Edward
happy
I
wonder
why
here
we
go
oh
what
is
happened
here
who
is
that
is
Thomas
happy
as_well
I
think
he
is
he
is
telling
James
and
Edward
how
important
he
is
oh
look
at
those
two
faces
James
is
saying
it
is
ever
so
steep
it
is
ever
so
steep
it
is
ever
so
steep
and
Edward's
saying
I
have
done
it
before
I
have
done
it
before
I
have
done
it
before
www
and
look
at
all
the
steam
coming
out_of
their
funnels
they
are
really
having
to
puff
hard
to
get
up
that
hill
here
they
are
at
the
next
station
James
is
laughing
www
and
who
is
that
and
what
is
he
wearing
yeah
and
why
was
James
worried
about
seeing
the
Fat_Controller
because
the
day
before
James
had
blown
steam
at
him
and
got
the
top
hat
wet
poor
Fat_Controller
with
a
wet
top
hat
