they
are
both
yellow
cars
be
not
they
have
you
got
any
more
yellow
vehicles
you
can
get
out
here
is
your
yellow
van
and
the
yellow
beach
buggy
and
a
yellow
bus
and
the
yellow
beach
buggy
trailer
all
these
yellow
vehicles
and
what
is
this
what
is
this
coming
up
and
what
color
is
it
blue
are
you
sure
no
it
is
yellow
I
think
that
is
all
the
yellow
vehicles
that
we
have
got
yeah
but
the
tractor's
not
yellow
never
mind
you
can
have
an
orange
tractor
get
some
red
vehicles
out
now
the
red
fire
red
train
another
red
fire
I
have
just
thought
of
another
yellow
vehicle
but
I
cannot
see
it
look
at
all
these
vehicles
parked
have
they
stopped
at
the
traffic
lights
right
well
they
would
better
move
off
then
otherwise
people
start
going
beep
in
fact
here
comes
the
fire
wanting
them
to
move
he
is
beeping
his
horn
they
would
better
start
moving
off
has
not
they
no
you
keep
the
door
closed
keep
the
door
closed
oh
right
shall
I
move
out_of
the
way
I
am
not
in
the
way
of
all
your
vehicles
are
you
making
a
long
line
no
they
cannot
because
that
is
really
a
baby
toy
that
is
right
can
you
remember
what
Peter_rabbit's
sisters
are
called
what
the
other
little
rabbits
are
called
they
are
Flopsy
Mopsy
and
Cottontail
be
not
they
there
is
a
little
rabbit
somewhere
that
sits
on
that
rabbit's
back
let
us
have
a
look
for
it
should
be
in
here
somewhere
with
all
the
other
animals
and
vehicles
cannot
see
it
a
there
it
is
little
rabbit
fits
on
the
big
rabbit
has
it
where
did
it
go
on
the
aeroplane
a
well
it
is
called
a
beach
buggy
it
is
a
special
vehicle
that
drives
on
the
sand
because
you
have
got
the
little
trailer
and
there
is
a
boat
somewhere
that
goes
on
the
trailer
because
if
you
have
a
boat
at
he
seaside
you
need
to
have
a
special
vehicle
that
can
pull
it
down
so
it
can
get
into
the
sea
do
you
remember
seeing
them
when
we
were
with
the
girls
in
Kent
I
do
not
know
where
the
little
boat
is
probably
in
the
bath
another
red
stop
oh
the
vehicles
should
not
really
bump
at
red
lights
if
you
keep
on
bumping
like
that
the
police
car
will
come
it
is
a
tape
recorder
it
is
Anna's
yes
what
color
is
it
oh
that
police
car
will
come
with
his
oh
here
is
the
boat
that
goes
on
the
beach
buggy
like
that
and
it
drives
down
to
the
sea
do
not
keep
bashing
the
police
car
will
come
at
the
moment
I
do
not
think
it
will
have
a
policeman
in
it
no
it
has
not
has
it
here
comes
the
police
car
nee
coming
to
see
what
is
happening
yes
police
cars
do
not
bump
other
vehicles
you
tell
me
who
is
it
mhm
what
is
the
big
rabbit
called
and
what
is
the
little
rabbit
called
oh
it
is
just
called
rabbit
is
it
is
it
little
rabbit
have
they
are
they
where
are
where
are
the
missing
rabbits
on
the
kitchen
door
I
do
not
think
so
Mummy
does
not
have
rabbits
there
yeah
well
how
many
wheels
has
he
got
altogether
he
is
got
two
at
the
front
and
two
at
the
back
but
how
many
are
there
altogether
because
all
these
wheels
how
many
are
there
that
is
it
because
there
is
two
at
the
front
and
two
at
the
back
they
are
creaky
wheels
be
not
they
that
is
a
good
place
for
him
is
not
it
mhm
well
yeah
I
would
have
thought
it
was
a
tractor
rather
than
a
digger
because
diggers
normally
have
scoops
do
not
they
that
is
right
that
is
the
spare
wheel
is
not
it
in_case
one
of
the
other
wheels
gets
broken
that
is
right
would
you
like
to
have
a
little
swim
in
the
sea
would
you
maybe
we
can
arrange
it
when
we
go
on
holiday
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
you
would
not
go
in
last
time
we
went
to
the
sea
it
was
not
cold
well
a
bit
chilly
you
would
not
even
put
your
toes
in
would
you
do
you
remember
the
water
came
up
and
you
ran
away
screaming
it
is
a
very
long
line
of
vehicles
is
not
it
are
you
next
time
what
where
are
you
going
on
the
bus
where
are
you
going
on
the
bus
get
your
hand
out_of
your
trousers
oh
we
have
got
mhm
two
lines
of
traffic
have
not
we
we
have
got
vehicles
going
in
one
direction
and
some
more
going
in
another
pardon
all
these
cars
what
about
the
breakdown
you
have
got
a
crane
it
is
not
as
big
as
Old_Bear's
crane
though
is
it
he
has
what
does
he
do
with
it
yeah
and
what
happens
and
then
what
happens
yes
because
Jolly
does
not
like
going
up
high
does
he
when
Little_bear
takes
his
paw
off
Jolly's
eyes
Jolly
starts
to
wobble
that
is
right
and
where
does
Little_bear
go
no
he
flys
across
the
room
and
lands
on
the
yes
how
does
he
get
down
well
sort
of
Little_bear
slides
down
Jolly's
neck
does
not
he
yeah
that
is
the
car
that
used
to
have
the
caravan
attached
is
not
it
the
caravan's
broken
now
no
I
do
not
know
where
the
caravan
is
it
is
not
in
here
well
it
is
not
in
here
anyway
what
are
you
after
which
one
I
wonder
where
your
purple
beetle
car
is
never
mind
you
have
got
your
red
one
have
not
you
oh
yes
what
is
that
wheel
for
yes
what
is
it
doing
in
the
bonnet
it
is
the
spare
wheel
in_case
one
of
the
other
wheels
gets
broken
do
you
remember
when
we
saw
that
man
putting
a
new
wheel
on
his
car
one
of
his
wheels
had
broken
and
he
had
to
put
his
spare
wheel
on
Mummy
and
Daddy
have
got
a
spare
wheel
in
their
car
but
it
is
in
the
boot
not
in
the
bonnet
because
beetle
are
special
cars
because
their
engines
are
at
the
back
yes
they
are
be
not
they
yeah
the
back
wheels
are
stuck
though
what
we
need
well
we
do
need
a
screwdriver
so
we
can
take
the
bottom
plate
off
maybe
Mummy'll
have
a
go
at
mending
it
later
no
not
really
the
wheels
are
are
broken
that
is
right
engines
are
normally
in
bonnets
you
see
beetle
are
unusual
because
they
have
their
engine
at
the
back
in
the
boot
well
spare
wheels
can
go
in
bonnets
yes
some
or
they
can
go
in
boots
or
they
can
go
on
the
back
of
vehicles
like
the
Land_Rover
ow
why
I
think
you
would
say
ow
if
a
dumper
truck
drove
over
your
toes
would
not
you
yes
well
they
are
not
poorly
that
is
a
very
long
line
of
vehicles
do
not
think
it
is
big
enough
I
tell
you
what
let
us
get
this
little
car
out
I
wonder
if
that
little
car
would
fit
underneath
yes
let
us
see
if
I
can
find
any
more
little
cars
little
vehicles
there
is
a
little
vehicle
we
have
not
got
many
small
vehicles
really
oh
dear
shall
the
ambulance
come
see
if
everyone's
all
right
nee
whoops
now
that
is
crashed
into
the
Land_Rover
I
think
the
Land_Rover's
probably
all
right
silly
that
is
right
where
have
you
picked
that
one
up
who
is
taught
you
that
Warren
Charlie
did
he
right
it
is
all
coming
out
now
oh
I
shall
have
words
with
his
Mother
I
think
I
suppose
it
could
have
been
worse
you
want
another
little
one
we
have
not
got
many
small
vehicles
you
see
oh
that
might
fit
under
oh
here
is
a
small
one
well
here
is
the
taxi
the
taxi
will
fit
oh
oh
I
thought
you
meant
fit
under
the
rabbit
I
do
not
think
anything
actually
fixes
on
to
the
back
of
the
breakdown
truck
pass
me
the
breakdown
truck
pass
it
over
let
me
look
let
us
see
well
it
might
do
if
you
hook
it
over
the
little
thing
there
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
I
do
not
think
it
will
I
think
that
is
very
optimistic
bash
it
back
no
let
us
push
it
back
gently
it
is
reversing
back
now
the
little
beetle
car's
coming
through
brumm
turning
round
going
back
under
oh
no
they
are
all
pushing
each_other
it
has
broken
has
not
it
why
do
not
you
mend
it
oh
it
has
come
off
has
not
it
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
you
will
have_to
move
that
sports
car
then
you
can
put
a
sports
car
at
the
back
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
not
unless
you
move
the
other
vehicles
backwards
that
is
it
look
at
all
these
vehicles
oh
no
we
do
not
want
to
play
the
music
Mummy
was
just
moving
it
out_of
the
way
you
play
with
your
vehicles
instead
I
will
put
he
music
in
there
for
later
yeah
that
is
a
little
car
against
the
bus
is
not
it
pardon
that
is
it
oh
is
it
oh
dear
this
is
very
annoying
is
not
it
just
moving
forwards
a
little
way
and
having
to
stop
again
there
you
go
there
we
go
oh
I
see
that
cheeky
engine's
pushed
in
has
he
turned
in
from
a
side
road
I
do
not
think
he
knows
where
he
is
going
does
he
well
I
think
Harry
fixed
that
one
actually
it
was
not
Granddad
Harry
did
fix
it
because
it
had
stopped
working
so
it
could
not
make
the
horrible
noise
and
Harry
fixed
it
so
it
would
work
so
now
it
makes
the
horrible
noise
again
that
is
why
we
have
not
sent
Harry
a
birthday
present
no
I
do
not
think
they
can
the
doors
on
here
open
though
do
not
they
on
the
Land_Rover
let
us
just
have
a
look
at
this
oh
the
doors
do
not
open
I
wonder
how
he
gets
in
and
out
what
do
you
mean
no
oh
he
stays
in
this
one's
much
makes
a
much
better
noise
much
more
gentle
is
not
it
he
is
going
to
reverse
back
he
did
did
not
he
it
is
not
really
an
amusing
thing
Warren
cars
bumping
each_other
oh_my_goodness
well
no
oh
dear
that
is
a
horrible
accident
is
not
it
does
the
ambulance
need
to
go
and
see
if
anybody's
hurt
see
if
anyone's
poorly
nee
