has_to
stand
up
he
will
fit
on
there
he
can
stand
at
the
front
and
get
smoke
in
his
face
perhaps
I
will
sit
him
stand
him
at
the
back
there
is
a
man
in
the
cab
that
monkey's
got
a
good
hold

Warren
I
have
a
suspicion
about
that
silence
child
www
Mummy's
going
to
build
a
tower
now
Mummy's
Mummy's
making
a
tower
a
strong
tower
what
is
it
tell
me
what
it
is
no
it
is
a
goat
look
at
Mummy's
tall
tower
it
is
a
tall
one
is
not
it
but
it
is
not
very
stable
I
think
it
might
fall
over
do
not
bash
it
especially
not
on
your
head
if
that
is
what
you
were
thinking
of
doing
no
if
you
want
to
break
it
up
break
it
up
on
the
floor
that
is
a
good
boy
Warren
can
break
it
up
pull
the
bricks
off
there
you
see
it
is
a
well
built
tower
that
one
Warren
you
have_to
use
force
to
undo
it
oh
no
be
gentle
with
them
remember
they
are
not
your
toys
are
they
whose
toys
are
they
Anna's
toys
you
are
not
to
break
her
toys
she
would
have
nothing
to
play
with
at
home
well
Warren
had
better
put
the
train
back
together
then
there
is
the
cab
but
you
do
not
know
how
it
goes
back
together
what
is
that
do
you
know
what
it
is
can
you
remember
cow
right
let
us
put
it
back
on
shall
we
right
I
think
we
ought_to
put
this
back
together
again
I
am
not
sure
how
it
works
or
how
it
goes
back
together
well
make
sure
you
make
it
like
that
then
put
the
blue
square
behind
the
cow
put
that
behind
the
cow
no
a
cabless
engine
a
boilerless
engine
a
funnelless
engine
and
a
domeless
engine
no
lights
either
that
is
a
bit
of
a
danger
especially
as
there
is
no
driver
what
is
gone
well
at
least
we
have
got
a
cab
that
is
right
is
not
it
that
does
not
go
there
you
have
got
a
bit
missing
you
have
got
the
funnel
missing
this
bit
needs
to
go
on
does
not
it
are
you
sure
you
need
a
blue
square
put
that
on
behind
the
cow
right
no
right
next_to
it
put
it
on
here
just
here
that
is
it
now
the
funnel
bit
goes
on
top
of
that
that
is
it
and
the
cab
goes
behind
the
funnel
bit
the
cab
there
goes
right
at
the
back
that
is
it
that
thing
is
the
coupling
where
you
couple
on
coaches
or
trucks
yeah
what
a
cheeky
old
dome
I
do
not
know
hiding
in
the
bricks
what
are
you
looking
for
now
that
one
does
go
there
that
is
it
and
where
is
the
driver
well
I
am
not
sure
which
way
round
it
goes
I
do
not
really
think
it
matters
probably
goes
that
way
round
