actually
my
knuckle
that
it

but
never
mind
count
to
three
whoops
this
ball
is
supposed
to
be
played
with
in
the
bath
Warren
see
if
we
can
get
it
whizzing
round
again
shall
we
there
we
go
look
at
it
spinning
round
in
the
middle
Henry's
not
very
good
at
it
is
he
Henry's
getting
bored
he
wants
to
go
on
the
track
let
us
see
if
we
can
put
some
more
exciting
things
on
this
track
for
Henry
to
play
with
yeah
that
is
probably
a
good
idea
is
not
it
shall
we
put
a
lion
in
the
field
which
field
shall
the
lion
go
in
okay
where
is
this
lion
from
it
was
off
Adam's
birthday
cake
that
is
right
can
you
remember
how
many
candles
Adam
had
hooray
did
you
yeah
hey
it
is
good
playing
in
here
because
we
do
not
have_to
rush
anywhere
to
look
out_of
the
window
at
the
ambulances
do
we
we
see
lots_of
ambulances
do
not
we
so
did
I
those
two
lovely
animals
what
kind
of
lovely
animals
are
they
well
you
tell
me
what
are
they
what
kind
of
animal
are
they
are
they
lions
what
are
they
they
are
sheep
with
long
long
horns
be
not
they
we
saw
some
sheep
the
other
day
with
long
horns
and
we
saw
some
goats
with
long
long
horns
as_well
did
not
we
the
goats
had
longer
horns
than
the
sheep
had
you
are
an
elephant
I
always
thought
there
was
something
strange
about
you
is
that
what
it
is
you
are
an
elephant
and
I
always
thought
you
were
a
boy
a
level
crossing
is
it
there
is
some
vehicles
waiting
at
the
level
crossing
wrong
vehicle
waiting
which
vehicle
should
it
be
no
they
do
not
no
they
do
not
come
on
roads
do
they
I
do
not
think
trams
do
sometimes
but
trains
do
not
and
Henry
is
definitely
a
train
he
is
not
a
tram
yes
trams
do
but
trains
do
not
trains
stay
on
rails
no
because
the
problem
is
you
are
not
going
to
listen
to
reason
are
you
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
we
saw
a
helicopter
this
morning
did
not
we
is
the
helicopter
in
here
are
its
rotor
in
there
because
they
were
kicking
about
in
your
bed
were
not
they
I
think
your
rotor
may
be
somewhere
missing
maybe
I
vacuumed
them
up
last
night
yes
keys
for
the
windows
of
our
last
house
yes
they
are
your
keys
there
is
one
of
those
keys
that
we
need
to
post
back
yeah
your
rotor
be
not
here
I
am
afraid
no
that
is
not
right
this
is
the
key
for
that
shall
we
wind
it
up
no
do
not
bash
it
I
do
not
think
so
make
sure
you
do
not
run
over
your
biscuit
it
was
well
keep
the
wheels
on
the
floor
while
you
wind
it
up
otherwise
it
will
just
unwind
bash
what
are
you
after
right
okay
the
problem
is
it
is
a
very
strong
train
it
might
knock
them
over
but
it
is
a
very
good
idea
oh
no
it
cannot
it
is
all
fenced
in
is
not
it
is
there
another
one
I
did
not
know
that
we
had
more
than
three
that
is
right
and
Warren
you
know
Gnome
her
boyfriend
drives
a
policecar
he
is
just
learning
how
to
drive
it
very
fast
so
he
can
chase
people
is
that
exciting
you
have
never
been
in
a
fire
have
you
you
have
never
been
in
an
ambulance
either
perhaps
one
day
you
might
be
able
to
go
in
an
ambulance
in
the
ambulance
station
down
the
road
well
they
do
go
well
it
might
fall
off
yes
what
a
funny
thing
did
you
what
just
now
just
drove
past
who
knocked
the
lion
over
a
where
is
Gnome
Gnome's
in
the
hall
talking
to
Daddy
Gnome's
going
to
go
to
the
shops
with
Daddy
no
we
are
going
to
some
shops
with
Daddy
and
Gnome
this
afternoon
and
you
are
going
to
buy
a
vehicle
you
are
going
to
choose
one
be
not
you
we
are
going
to
go
to
a
vehicle
shop
and
you
will
choose
one
because
you
have
just
had
your
tenth
night
without
a
dummy
it
is
a
good
job
you
survived
because
we
did
not
have
any
to
give
you
as
spares
no
it
has
not
bye
are
you
going
to
wave
out_of
the
window
I
had
not
realized
the
wind
man
was
here
look
there
is
the
wind
man
van
wind
man's
van
he
has
I
bet
they
flash
orange
do
not
you
he
is
mending
our
leaky
wind
Mummy
got
wet
feet
did
not
she
on
the
way
back
from
Irene'shouse
Mummy
shrieked
and
said
oh
what
is
that
on
my
foot
and
I
could
not
stop
and
look
could
I
because
we
were
on
a
windy
country
lane
in
the
pouring
rain
and
there
was
nowhere
to
stop
and
then
a
bit
later
on
oh
what
is
that
on
my
other
foot
is
that
what
happens
in
the
rain
you
sometimes
play
out
in
the
rain
do
not
you
that
is
right
and
what
do
you
have
on
your
feet
that
is
right
you
have
got
shoes
on
now
and
I
think
you
are
going
to
need
new
shoes
I
hope
right
before
I
forget
Warren
shall
we
put
the
answerphone
on
actually
no
we
will
leave
it
off
because
it
will
probably
be
quicker
for
me
actually
to
answer
the
phone
no
we
will
leave
it
on
because
otherwise
we
will
have_to
um
listen
to
the
message
and
it
might
be
something
secret
and
private
might
not
it
you
want
to
see
that
man
well
he
is
in
the
garage
you
will
be
able
to
see
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
will
be
a
little
while
he
will
be
quite
a
while
mending
the
wind
no
not
this
window
the
wind
on
the
car
the
thing
you
look
out_of
at
the
front
yeah
with
the
little
stickers
on
he
is
he
is
mending
it
because
it
is
leaking
Mummy
got
wet
feet
and
we
got
a
wet
carpet
are
you
sleeping
a
I
have
no
idea
where
oh
it
popped
I
do
know
where
it
is
it
popped
it
did
Daddy
Daddy
who
was
Daddy
with
when
it
popped
Malcolm
do
you
remember
when
oh
no
you
were
in
bed
no
you
were
not
in
bed
when
Malcolm
came
and
Mummy
was
ironing
and
you
were
watching
the
dog
and
the
cat
and
you
were
playing
with
your
balloon
were
not
you
then
Mummy
took
you
up
for
your
bath
and
Daddy
and
Malcolm
were
sitting
in
the
kitchen
having
a
drink
and
suddenly
the
balloon
went
pop
and
it
burst
and
Daddy
does
not
know
why
it
went
pop
because
it
was
just
sitting
there
it
does
balloons
do
pop
if
you
sit
on
them
generally
do
not
they
you
had
a
really
good
one
a
shiny
one
that
went
float
float
float
in
the
air
they
did
that
is
right
and
James
came
off
the
rails
in
a
field
did
not
he
with
some
animals
in
it
can
you
remember
what
the
animals
were
in
the
field
where
James
came
off
the
rails
what
were
they
they
were
cows
were
not
they
you
have
tipped
have
not
you
oh
dear
shall
oh
let
us
get
the
crane
to
lift
you
up
here
is
the
crane
let
us
lift
the
boy
let
us
hook
this
round
oh
it
is
not
on
very
well
let
us
tuck
it
in
right
up
you
come
come
on
the
crane's
lifting
you
come
on
up
you
come
oh
it
is
come
unhooked
let
us
hook
it
in
again
let
us
hook
it
in
here
lift
the
boy
lift
him
up
up
you
come
hooray
that
is
a
good
crane
is
not
it
that
can
lift
boys
up
it
probably
would
lift
the
sheep
up
actually
we
should
not
really
be
playing
with
these
these
are
Daddy's
sheep
never
mind
look
at
that
a
sheep
on
a
crane
brumm
which
field's
he
going
in
is
he
going
in
the
field
with
the
lion
and
the
cows
it
is
a
bit
of
a
dangerous
field
for
sheep
because
lions
like
eating
sheep
they
probably
like
eating
cows
actually
never
mind
tell
you
what
shall
we
put
the
sheep
in
the
field
with
Terrence
the
tractor
there
is
one
sheep
with
Terrence
what
are
you
doing
are
you
trying
to
lift
the
other
sheep
you
hook
it
on
then
oh
he
is
is
not
he
poor
Terrence
with
a
sheep
standing
on
him
they
do
keep
falling
on
the
rail
I
hope
Henry
does
not
come
and
run
that
sheep
over
will
Henry
stop
that
is
good
so
what
is
going
to
happen
what
can
Henry
do
can
he
a
flying
train
is
that
because
he
is
called
the
Flying_Kipper
sometimes
this
tunnel
Henry's
tunnel
yes
it
is
not
a
very
good
idea
kneeling
like
that
right
can
you
just
stand
up
I
will
move
my
legs
and
then
you
can
kneel
properly
like
that
