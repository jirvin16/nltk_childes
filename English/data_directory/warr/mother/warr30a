980
they
are
broken
no
Granddad's
very
clever
at
mending
things
but
he
cannot
mend
the
tyres
no
these
are
broken
tyres
now
they
cannot
be
mended
look
at
that
one
there
is
only
one
tyre
on
the
car
that
is
all
right
no
that
one's
broken
that
one's
broken
and
that
one's
broken
that
one's
very
broken
no
do
not
do
that
you
will
spoil
them
the
poor
car
with
broken
tyres
has
it
yeah
no
it
is
not
that
is
because
you
cannot
break
it
that
is
the
only
reason
why
well
it
still
runs
does
not
it
it
just
probably
perhaps
cannot
go
very
fast
oh
look
at
that
tyre
it
is
a
bit
heavy
for
this
breakdown
is
not
it
it
is
too
heavy
shall
we
build
a
fence
on
this
lego
that
one
is
broken

I
wonder
if
we
can
see
the
other
part
of
it

might
have
broken
a
long
time

Daddy

look
at
all
these
roofing
tiles
I

what
you
do
is
you
kind
of
fit
them
together
and
you
can
make
little
roofs
for
houses
make
little
lego
houses
and
put
roofs
on
yes
no
it
is
quite
difficult
making
houses
out_of
lego
because
you
need
to
remember
things
like
doors
and
windows
I
always
used
to
forget
those
here
is
a
little
house
some
bits
of
roof
missing
I
wonder
if
we
can
find
those
missing
pieces
for
the
roof
this
is
a
different
kind
of
roof
this
is
no
it
cannot
fit
in
you
are
quite
right
oh
I
wonder
where
those
missing
pieces
might
be
whoops
is
that
one
right
no
silly
Mummy
is
it
okay
let
us
let
us
just
pull
it
apart

not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
oh
no
oh

poor
Mummy
will
get
into
trouble
if
I
have
broken
it
what
you
try
putting
it

then
from
the
back
like
that
yes
now
we
are
a
bit
another
bit
missing
here
a
little
red
bit
missing
I
wonder
where
that
might
be
oh
hang
on
hang
on
hang
on
let
us
just
wreck
this
again
oh
no
oh
no
oh
no
silly
old
Mummy

Mummy
silly
oh
is
Mummy
sensible
a
hey
ho
Warren
look
can
you
put
that
back
please
I
am
trying
to
mend
it
why
are
you
breaking
it
apart
oh
it
is
all
broken
all
broken
oh
does
not
do
not
you
want
a
door
in
your
house
that
is
a
door
look
well
how
are
people
going
to
get
in
and
out
if
there
is
no
door
yes
but
darling
if
there
is
no
door
how
are
they
going
to
get
in
and
out
through
the
window
what
a
funny
boy
in
and
out
through
the
window
why
is
the
bonnet
up
on
that
mini
let
us
have
a
look
you
show
me
the
mini
car
why
is
the
bonnet
up
oh
it
is
got
a
piece
of
lego
in
the
engine
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
no
little
pieces
will
fit
in
little
pieces
like
these
will
fit
in
shall
we
see
how
many
pieces
we
can
fit
it
whoops
look
at
all
those
pieces
are
they
all
out
that
one's
driving
is
it
has
it
let
us
have
a
look
no
I
think
it
is
just
the
axle's
jammed
this
one
has
not
worked
for
a
long
time
has
it
perhaps
tomorrow
you
might
be
able
to
choose
another
vehicle
like
that
do
you
think
along
with
a
book
no
the
wheels
cannot
be
mended
no
they
cannot
I
am
afraid
Mummy's
tried
and
Granddad's
tried
and
we
have
both
failed
and
if
Mummy
cannot
do
it
and
Granddad
cannot
do
it
then
there

no
chance
for
anyone
doing
it
no
the
wheels
just
do
not
go
round
that
is
the
problem
well
I
think
I
think
the
car
needs
to
go
to
the
garage
really
does
not
it
for
somebody
to
mend
it
perhaps
we
should
have
taken
it
to
the
garage
this
morning
with
Mummy's
car
well
yes
Daddy's
and
Mummy's
Mummy's
at
the
moment
because
Mummy's
driving
it
but
I
am
not
driving
it
am
I
Derek's
driving
it
that
man
is
driving
it
he
probably
is
it
is
and
it
is
broken
really
yes
it
is
what
color
is
it
what
color
is
your
car
green
rubbish
what
is
this
what
color's
this
it
is
not
called
green
it
is
called
white
and
what
color's
this
it
is
like
Mummy
and
Daddy's
car
is
not
it
what
color
is
it
it
is
izzy
whizzy
let
us
get
busy
that
is
a
funny
color
it
is
black
with
a
white
roof
those
are
green
be
not
they
no
it
is
not
that
is
right
and
what
color's
the
roof
well
it
is
green
now
because
you
are
putting
the
tiles
on
it
yes
what
color's
your
t
well
it
is
where
you
have
put
the
tile
what
color's
the
dog
yes
what
color's
the
dog
if
there
is
no
tile
is
it
that
is
probably
because
you
are
jabbing
lego
bricks
into
it
oh
do
not
that'll
hurt
strange
child
how
many
bricks
have
you
got
in
there
yeah
not
very
good
at
balancing
is
it
shall
we
try
and
balance
the
roof
on
your
leg
there
you
go
oh
dear
shall
we
try
balancing
this
road
sign
on
your
knee
hold
your
knee
very
still
oh
that
was
not
much
good
was
it
try
that
way
a
propped
up
now
is
not
it
well
I
hope
the
car
does
go
stop
otherwise
he
would
bash
the
engine
would
not
he
the
front
in
well
it
is
not
really
a
very
good
idea
for
cars
to
crash
that
is
why
they
have
brakes
yes
they
do
but
it
is
not
nice
if
they
do
oh
dear
oh
dear
had
the
ambulance
better
come
and
the
policecar
oh
who
is
on
the
phone
it
is
for
you
no
it
is
for
you
oh
have
they
hung
up
oh
is
it
who
is
it
who
did
you
phone
is
Charlie
on
the
phone
where
is
Charlie
well
that
is
because
you
are
not
really
supposed
to
get
round
you
will
decapitate
yourself
why
are
you
crawling
round
there
are
you
going
to
be
up
to
wickedness
are
you
doing
wicked
things
round
there
oh
Warren

you
peeping
I
can
just
see
your
tufty
hair
sticking
up
you
need
a
hair
do
not
you
who
is
Matt
no
Matt
is
not
going
to
cut
it
well
Matt
does
cut
long
hair
but
he
does
cut
short
hair
as_well
it
is
just
that
Mummy
has
not
got
Matt's
phone
number
so
she
cannot
get
him
to
come
here
we
will
take
you
to
Dean's

your
fault
for
kicking
Anna's
foot
mate

we
going
to
buy
you
a
book
tomorrow
no
why
are
we
going
to
get
you
a
book
is
it
because
you
are
a
big
boy
yeah
there
was
was
not
there
a
what
is
that
a
brick
a
right
I
thought
it
was
something
more
sinister
why
are
we
going
to
buy
you
a
book
tomorrow
can
you
remember
can
you
remember
do
you
remember
why
are
you
getting
smily
faces

a
chart
can
you
remember

a
big
boy
