that
is
a
good
idea
okay
the
panda's
bare
as_well
he
normally
has
clothes
on
does
not
he
where
is
the
panda
going
is
he
just
driving
around

a
little
drive
I
do
not
know
shall
we
look
for
her
pants
are
you
going
to
put
them
on
her
I
hope
you
put
them
on
her
more
successfully
than
you
put
your
own
pants
on
you
fell
down
the
stairs
the
other
day
did
not
you
because
you
would
got
two
legs
in
one
leg
hole
you
got
tangled
up
did
not
you
a
bit
like
a
mermaid
put
the
right
leg
through
the
right
leg
hole
like
that
the
left
leg
through
the
left
leg
hole
like
that
and
then
you
pull
them
up
she
is
got
plain
white
pants
has
not
she
you
have
got
some
plain
white
pants
as_well
I
think
you
are
wearing
green
ones
today
yeah
dolly's
got
white
ones
I
think
yours
are
green
yes
they
are
you
have
got
green
ones
on
oh
yes
there
is
a
hippo
in
the
trailer
there
is
part
of
the
train
I
think
somebody's
taken
the
train
apart
shall
we
look
for
the
pieces
and
maybe
okay
if
that
makes
you
happy
are
you
moving
all
these
things
out_of
the
way
that
is
a
good
idea
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
are
you
going
to
tip
right
that
is
all
the
pieces
out
now
is
not
it
a
there
is
part
of
the
train
as_well
you
have
got
the
cab
and
here
is
the
cow
there
we
go
where
is
the
driver
hooray
no
he
has
not
you
will
have_to
find
him
some
coaches
right
are
you
going
to
go
and
find
his
coaches
now
can
I
just
do
your
shoelace
up
Warren
we
will
just
do
up
your
shoelace
it
is
a
bit
short
because
it
broke
did
not
it
these
are
very
ancient
shoes
your
feet
have
not
grown
for
months
and
months
and
months
there
you
go
it
will
fit
if
you
just
get
it
in
the
right
position
like
there
that
is
it
a
I
see
you
are
getting
them
the
right
way
round
to
get
coupled
that
is
very
sensible
where
is
the
engine
taking
the
train
where
is
the
hippo
going
oh
what
are
they
going
to
do
in
Manchester
are
they
going
to
go
shopping
in
Manchester
that
is
a
good
idea
where
did
I
put
your
mat
oh
it
is
there
oh
right
they
are
standing
in
a
nice
line
be
not
they
they
are
being
very
polite
how
many
people
are
there
on
the
train
excellent
okay
I
do
not
think
that
engine
fits
on
your
track
Warren
no
well
I
do
not
know
that
it
is
a
good
idea
having
your
vehicles
out
we
could
get
your
mat
out
could
not
we
for
the
train
to
go
on
your
mat's
just
next_to
the
box
just
next_to
the
vehicle
box
on
the
floor
because
we
know
that
that
mat's
yours
do
not
we
that
is
right
this
is
a
good
mat
is
not
it
for
downstairs
on
the
shiny
floors
because
it
does
not
slip
right
and
then
Anna's
train
can
come
on
this
track
cannot
it
what
is
the
matter
somebody
had
better
open
the
gate
then
okay
those
poor
people
on
the
train
waiting
to
go
to
Manchester
shopping
never
mind
that
is
right
there
is
a
blue
one
over
there
near
the
cow
the
bull
we
saw
some
pigs
the
other
day
did
not
we
they
were
having
a
shower
from
the
hose
pipe
they
liked
getting
the
water
on
their
bodys
did
not
they
it
was
a
hot
day
oh
I
see
you
have
made
a
level
crossing
be
not
you
clever
are
you
clever
no
is
somebody
going
to
come
and
open
the
gates
well
shall
Mummy
open
one
and
Warren
open
the
other
who
is
oh
the
panda's
going
to
open
the
gate
now
that
is
a
good
idea
be
not
you
kind
helping
panda
I
will
hold
that
still
and
you
and
panda
can
open
the
gate
oh
panda's
right
well
what
we
can
do
we
will
put
the
gate
on
there
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
there
we
go
right
is
the

if
the
panda
stands
up
I
have
never
tried
actually
oh
balancing
the
panda
hooray
he
is
not
a
very
good
train
driver
is
he
if
his
passengers
keep
falling
out
so
what
is
going
to
happen
to
those
people
that
have
fallen
out_of
the
train
oh
is
he
going
to
see
if
they
are
all
right
oh
why
is
he
what
is
he
doing
then
if
you
push
them
down
like
that
that
is
it
blow
the
whistle
you
count
and
then
I
will
blow
well
we
would
better
get
the
gate
open
then
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
should
not
fall
over
that
is
right
if
we
have
it
across
like
that
diagonally
it
should
not
fall
over
let
us
just
see
if
it
will
fall
over
see
brill
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
oh
that
might
fall
over
oh
yes
it
can
put
it
like
that
do
you
see
how
it
is
going
diagonally
across
the
square
it
just
stays
upright
shall
panda
close
this
one
well
they
are
not
going
to
get
to
Manchester
very
quickly
are
they
all
these
gates
closed
oh
that
is
better
is
not
it
why
poor
panda
why
was
he
sad
before
he
is
happy
now
was
he
sad
before
right
that
is
all
that
matters
really
is
not
it
did
you
no
I
have
never
been
on
a
panda
either
I
do
not
think
you
can
go
on
pandas
not
real
ones
might
be
able
to
go
on
toy
pandas
pretend
play
pandas
at
the
park
do
they
you
be
Fire
you
were
Fireman_Sam
earlier
on
today
were
not
you
you
were
squirting
us
with
that
belt
hose
two
what
what
is
this
for
oh
this
egg
box
is
getting
broken
is
not
it
no
you
did
not
break
it
pet
I
do
not
think
somebody
did
break
it
okay
shall
we
put
the
bricks
away
shall
Mummy
put
the
bricks
away
while
you
get
the
shopping
out
okay
it
is
far
more
exciting
getting
shopping
out
than
putting
bricks
away
are
you
eating
mm
very
tasty
oh
yes
how
many
eggs
have
you
got
which
little
hole
that'll

one
two
three
well

poorly
they
do
not
need
to
go
in
