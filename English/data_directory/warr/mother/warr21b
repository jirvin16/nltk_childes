Granddad

what

you

the
two
men
the
other
two

where

where

a
how
many
now
rubbish
rubbish
even

rubbish
rubbish
Warren
I
should
be
encouraging
you
positively
just
talking
rubbish
are

yours
mhm
I
suppose
they
are

they

Anna's
yes
are
they
what
are
they
talking
about
are
they
talking
about
the
weather
or
shopping
what
are
they
talking
about
are
they
talking
about
all
the
animals
they
can
see
what
can
you
hear
I
have
no
idea
where
it
is
it
was
a
bee
or
a
wasp
or
a
fly
or
something
well
no
it
was
not
a
butterfly
because
butterflys
do
not
make
buzzy
noises
butterflys
are
very
quiet
it
might
have
been
a
fly
it
might
even
if
it
was
a
bee
it
might
have
been
outside
because
bees
sometimes
buzz
so
loud
that
you
can
hear
them
through
the
window
if
they
are
very
close
it
might
have
been
that
wasp
that
we
saw
the
other
day
in
the
bed
it
escaped
very
beautiful
wobble
wobble
wobble
wobble
