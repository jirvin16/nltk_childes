somewhere
with
a
green
body
and
brown
hair
look
he
is
by
the

yeah
you
have

Bulgie
Thomas's

Bertie
Thomas's
friend
Bertie's
a
nice
bus
is
not
he
that
is
not
a

if
you
just
get
that
that
is
it
yeah
he
is
sitting
on
the
Mummy
tiger
now
I
am
not
sure
I
would
fancy
riding
a
tiger
what
do
tigers
say
that
is
right
and
tigers
can
run
very
fast
they
can
run
faster
than
hippos
and
horses
I
think
oh
you
have
got
a
man
on
a
tiger
and
a
man
on
a
horse
shall
we
have
a
man
on
an
elephant
three
men
riding
three
animals
that
is
good
is
not
it
what
is
it
can
you
remember
what
that
bit's
called
it
is
an
udder
milk
gets
squirted
out_of
these
things
that
hang
down
and
it

collected
and
then
it
is
put
into
bottles
what
are
you
doing
which
other
one
other
what
the
hippo
or
the
man
well
look
for
him
he
is
got
red
hair
and
a
blue
top
it
is
near
a
horse
lying

no
he
is
not
on
the
horse
he
is
near
a
lying
down
horse
and
the
tiger
yeah
have
you
lost
the
other
man
now
you
will
have_to
move
this
one
over
a
bit
I
hope
you
learn
some
logic
soon
Warren
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
this
one
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
this
one
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
put
them
on
right
at
the
end
with
a
bit
sticking
out
put
him
on
right
at
the
end
with
a
bit
sticking
out
right
now
get
the
next
one
put
it
on
right
next_to
that
one
right
up
next_to
it
that
is
it
now
put
the
other
one
with
a
bit
hanging
over
the
edge
that
one
goes
there
yes
yes
see
how
many
have
you
got
now
how
many
count
again
one
two
three
how
many
how
many
five
okay
fine
there
might
be
two
invisible
men
there
as_well
I
suppose
now
that
is
sensible
www
oh
say
thank_you
to
Anna
you
do
not
need
that
gap
say
thank_you
to
Anna
what
are
you
looking
for
other
one
what
another
one
what
another
one
long
one
do
not
let
Daddy
see
you
doing
that
Warren
do
you
want
her
trousers
on
right
can
you
undo
her
velcro
please
right

you
take
the
dress
off
carefully

if
we
put
her
legs
out
now
are
you
going
to
thread
her
legs
into
the
trousers
oh
there
is
her
right
foot
and
oh
her
left
foot
there
she
is
she
is
got
her
trousers
on
is
that
better
I
think
she
might
be
a
bit
cold
with
just
trousers
on
are
you
still
sticking
those
men
on
they
do
not
need
to
go
right
at
the
end
on
this
one
because
it
is
a
long
one
they
can
go
further
along
now
put
it
on
the
floor
now
press
down
on
it
I
know
what
you
could
do
Warren
if
we
took
this
truck
bit
off
we
could
sit
the
men
on
here
where
is
the
other
man
are
you
sitting
on
him
no
oh
there
he
is
right
are
you
going
to
stick
them
on
there
then
they
can
go
for
a
ride
on
the
train
with
the
baby
tiger
looking
at
them
cannot

one
two
