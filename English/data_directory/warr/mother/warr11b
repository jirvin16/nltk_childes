a
girl
she
is
wearing
a
dress
boys
do
not
normally
wear
dresses

is

nice
thank_you

sit
on
here

watch
you
play
pardon
pardon
who
go
on
yeah
she
is
sitting
on
Humpty_Dumpty's
wall
but
Humpty_Dumpty's
in

spread
about

you
need
to

straighten

undo

Warren
put
it
on
the
girl
on
the
doll
I
know
was
that
a
nice
kiss
or
a
horrid
kiss
shall
we
put
this
blouse
on
her
then
to
keep
her
a
bit
warmer
I
bet
she
is
cold
at
the
moment
with
no
clothes
on
shall
I
put
these
trousers
on
Warren
shall
I
put
the
trousers
on
her
to
keep
her
legs
warm
is
that
a
good
idea
that
is
a
good
tower
there
we
go
is
that
better
is
she
warm
now
well
that
goes
with
something
I
suppose
she
could
wear
it
could
not
she
does
she
wear
it
like
a
bib
like
that
or
the
other
way
round
I
think
this
is
what
you
would
call
a
prissy
outfit
let
us
hope
you
are
never
responsible
for
dressing
a
female
my_goodness
stick
her
on
your
box
a
that
is
where
her
hair

is
you
were
sitting

shall
we
put
a
ribbon
in
her
hair
put
a
red
bow
in
her
hair
to
make
it
look
nice
what
other
animals
are
there
you
have
got
the
fish
out

you
have
got
the
tiger
