making
a
farm
now
right
so
we
need
to
get
these
bricks
that
is
a
it
is
a
big
one
is
it
that
is
a
little
one
mhm
so
I
am
making
a
farm
am
I
does
not
it
let
us
have
a
look
okay
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
how
do
you
know
it
is
a
lady
it
is
a
lady
is
it
you
have
decided
it
is
a
lady
oh
I
was
just
asking
you
said
it
was
that
was
Mummy's
fault
was
not
it
right
we
have
got
the
horse
in
there
I
am
afraid
you
are
going
to
have_to
wait
while
I
that
is
it
I
know
it
is
because
I
was
let
us
make
it
so
they
can
get
in
and
out
so
that
is
where
they
come
in
and
out
you
have
the
dog
with
the
horse
I
think
the
dog
will
get
upset
you
have
got
a
pig
in
there
as_well
can
you
see
it
horse
what
happy
no
shall
I
make
a
little
area
for
the
the
pigs
got
the
pigs
in
here
where
is
the
dog
two
three
where
so
we
have
got
three
pigs
so
that
is
the
area
for
the
pigs
and
oh
right
is
he
keeping
watch
over
the
animals
well
the
cows
do
not
climb
up
not
like
that
anyway
what
are
you
doing
one
chicken
mhm
well
this
actually
looks
like
a
goose
Dominic
alright
then
it
is
a
chicken
I
will
not
argue
with
you
now
we
need
to
make
a
little
area
for
which
ones
alright
then
okay
you
cannot
just
throw
them
in
you
would
not
do
that
if
you
were
a
real
farmer
would
you
eh
is
not
it
you
look
like
a
little
Jewish
boy
Dominic
you
do
not
just
throw
the
little
animals
in
there
like
that
they
will
not
be
very
happy
oh
it
makes
sense
if
you
put
it
somewhere
like
that
then
they
cannot
the
little
animals
cannot
get
out
can'
they
then
we
could
open
it
and
move
that
brick
and
then
they
they
could
come
out
like
that
they
can
all
come
out
then
cannot
they
if
they
were
standing
up
I
think
they
are
drunk
that
one
lay
down
oh
well
that
is
alright
then
is
that
one's
you
have
decided
that
one's
a
lady
horse

is
a
bit
of
ribbon
