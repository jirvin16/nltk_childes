I'm making a farm am I
doesn't it
let's have a look
okay
going going going going going going going going going
how do you know it's a lady
it's a lady is it
you've decided it's a lady
oh
I was just asking
you said it was
that was Mummy's fault wasn't it
right
we've got the horse in there
I'm afraid you're going to have_to wait while I
that's it
I know
it's because I was
let's make it so they can get in and out
so
that's where they come in and out
you have the dog with the horse
I think the dog will get upset
you've got a pig in there as_well
can you see it

shall I make a little area for the the pigs
got the pigs in here

this actually looks like a goose Dominic
alright then
it's a chicken
I willn't argue with you
now
we need to make a little area for which ones
alright then
okay
you can't just throw them in
you wouldn't do that if you were a real farmer would you
eh
isn't it
you look like a little Jewish boy
Dominic
you don't just throw the little animals in there like that
they willn't be very happy
oh
it makes sense if you put it somewhere like that
then they can't
the little animals can't get out can' they
then
we could open it
and move that brick
and then they they could come out
like that
they can all come out then can't they
if they were standing up
I think they're drunk
that one lay down
oh
