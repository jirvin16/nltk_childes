and keep the train on the track
www

Daddy can fix it can he
www
the train fell off the track did it

I know
it will do
and I'll fix it up later
but only if you tidy up this mess
going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going
because we need some space for it
not enough space
it needs at least this much space
and you've got_to leave it alone
you have_to let it run round the track
and not keep picking it up like you do
oh boy
who's not putting their hand over their mouth
who's not putting their hand over their mouth
go away
you can't tell the train and the truck to go away
that's not very fair
why can't he go on the back
why not
www
what's moved
it goes back together
who's not putting their hand over their mouth
going going going going going going going going going
www
there
going going going going going going going going
on back
will it stay
it willn't stay like that
I think you have_to put it that way
like that
if you go too fast it'll fall off
I wonder if you'll love trains if you're older
or if you'll have grown out_of it by then
www
I know
because you're going too fast for it
www
can I take it

www
where's the e
where is it
well

yes
that's right
well
it's not really supposed to be on the track darling
in real life if you found a car on the track the train would knock it off
there'd be a crash

oh
vroom
oh sorry
sorry
oh
is the train helping the car
well
what's the car doing on the track
because cars don't go on tracks like that Dominic
cars don't go on tracks like that you know
no
they don't
no
they don't
funny enough
there
oh
grrr
why did you do that
www
Dominic
be careful
why not
going going going going going going going going going going going
well
you sit on your cars all the time
oh
I'm sorry Dominic
I thought you wanted me to help you
mhm
there
so
you've got one two three things on the track that shouldn't really be on there
hey
are you not talking to me now
who's that
I know it can't go
well
actually
they're supposed to stay on there Dominic
trains don't crash as often as that you know
despite everything
does that join with that one
doesn't it
it does
there you go
oh Dominic
let her have something
that's very generous of you
is it alright if she has Postman_Pat's van
okay
well
she it's because she's grabbing things
you used to do things like that
wait until you she's a bit bigger and she clouts you over the head with one of them

Dominic
don't get upset
she's only moving them
she's not doing any harm
she's only moving them
she's not doing any harm
don't worry about it
alright
oh
www
leave it there
you are a little
you are a little horror
now
it's gone from being just a train track to being everything else
you're not not sure what you want to play with are you
well
what do you want to play with
oh
train and cars
Dominic
trains don't always crash
that's what I keep saying to you
I know on your Thomas video they crash but they don't always you know
honestly
Gordon fell in a ditch because he was being naughty
Gordon didn't fall in the hole
Thomas fell in the hole
no
he didn't fall in a hole
Gordon pulled Thomas out
you don't remember your videos and you watch them more than we do
www
you really don't watch them properly else you'd know
that's because you've got a fidgety bum and start wandering around when they're on
well
that's not how you're supposed to play with it is it
www
I said it's one of my favorite cars
how do you know it's not my favorite car
I don't want one
I was just saying
when you've got lots_of money Dominic you can buy me one
no no
it's the same
it's a Porsche
but it's not the one that I like
that's the one I like
no
it's that one
I I didn't say it wasn't yours
I said that's the one that I like
that's alright
I've got the other Porsche
and I'm not bothered
this is the one that if I had money I'd buy Dominic
this one
I know it's yours
