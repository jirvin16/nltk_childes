be
bound
right
well
are
you
going
to
build
the
platform
up
there
you
are
have
this
very
long
one
to
do
the
platform
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
well
because
that
shows
you
where
it
is
stopping
you
have
got_to
put
that
on
top
so_that
it
shows
you
where
the
train's
stopping
have
you
got
that
clock
off
that
little
carriage
over
there
so_that
the
lady
knows
what
time
it
is
the
train's
going
what
time
is
it
going
what
time
twenty
of
the
clock
there
is
no
twenty
of
the
clock
it
is
either
eight
of
the
clock
or
it
is
twenty
hundred
hours
I
do
not
think
it
is
going
as
late
as
that
I
think
it
is
going
at
er
ten
past
eleven
ten
past
ten
right
there
we
are
that
is
the
platform
is
it
and
here
is
the
lady
is
she
going
to
stand
there
right
let
us
have
a
look
at
this
train
oh
well
here
we
have
got
the
driver
have
not
we
what
goes
on
the
front
of
this
train
is
not
there
another
thing
like
that
no
the
clock
does
not
go
on
the
front
this
is
a
diesel
is
not
it
this
is
a
diesel
where
is
that
other
one
that
goes
on
the
front
what
have
you
done
with
it
have
you
and
Daddy
lost
it
oh
there
it
is
well
the
driver's
he
is
just
getting
ready
he
wants
to
talk
to
this
lady
first
of
all
because
she
wants
to
make
sure
of
which
train's
coming
next
does
not
she
because
you
do
not
just
get
on
any
old
train
that
stops
do
you
you
have
got_to
make
sure
you
are
getting
on
the
right
one
have
not
you
that
is
the
right
one
is
it
where
is
it
going
well
that
is
not
the
right
one
at
all
is
it
because
you
have
just
said
that
this
lady's
going
to
Edinburgh
so
if
that
train's
going
to
London
do
you
think
that
train'll
go
through
that
bridge
not
a
hope
we
are
going
to
have_to
go
in
for
engineering
works
on
the
line
here
be
not
we
well
because
Mummy
has
not
made
the
bridge
big
enough
you
are
supposed
to
know
how
to
build
this
bridge
you
and
Daddy
build
the
bridge
together
look
where
is
the
bottom
of
the
bridge
now
oh

you

a
couple
more
for

two
more
big
ones

do
you
think

want
that
on
the
top
do
you
right
do
bear
in
mind
that
Mummy
does
not
build
very
strong
bridges
darling
and
if
you
start
to
press
it
very
hard
it
will
break
just
like
that
do
you
not
press
Daddy's
bridges
as
hard
or
does
he
build
stronger
ones
does
does

a
bit
hungry
the
sharks

a
bit
hungry

he
is
in
the
river
now
what
is
happening
now
then
he
is
been
eaten
up
has
he
by
the
sharks
you
are
going
to
knock
the
sharks
away
how
are
you
going
to
do
that
with
your
breakdown
truck
find
your
breakdown
truck
then
now
if

the
front
properly
you
would
not
have
these
difficulties
would
you
where
is
your
breakdown
truck
it
is
lost
its
hook
though
it
is
lost
its
hook
well
I
do
not
know
where
it
is
right
well
you
would
better
come
down
and
get
it
then
had
not
you
got
it
where
is
it
then
well
you
said
Gumdrop
had
got
it
where
is
Gumdrop

think
it
is
probably
dropped
off
somewhere
do
you
think
I
have
hoovered
it
up
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
it
is
lost
its
hook
is
it
in
here
I
do
not
think
it
is
you
know
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
perhaps
Daddy
knows
where
it
is
hmm
it
is
not
there
now
is
it
I
do
not
know
if
I
knew
that
I
would
not
be
looking
for
it
would
I
no
perhaps
it
will
turn
up
come
on
you
can
have
oh
there
it
is
come
on
I
have
found
it
right
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
I
think
it
needs
a
pair
of
pliers
or
something
onto
it
there
we
are
all
present
and
correct
what
are
you
going
to
do
why
did
you
need
it
are
you
going
to
rescue
that
fire
you
were
going
to
use
your
breakdown
truck
to
deal
with
the
sharks
were
not
you
well
you
do
not
have_to
it
was
your
idea
has
he
what
is
going
to
happen
on
the
bank
is
all
the
water
going
to
come
off
the
fire
do
you
think
he
has
a
fish
stuck
in
his
ladder
is
it
that
was
a
failure
was
not
it
the
breakdown
truck
pulled
it
out
and
it
fell
back
in
again
did
not
it
what
is
happening
now
again
so
there
is
not
much
point
in
him
lifting
it
out
is
there
if
he
is
just
going
to
drop
it
back
in
again
would
not
it
be
better
to
take
it
back
to
the
garage
so
the
engine
can
be
dried
out
it
would
be
would
it
well
are
you
going
to
do
it
then
do
you
want
me
to
put
that
hook
in
the
right
place
