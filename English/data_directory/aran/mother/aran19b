play
meeting
the
horse
where
are
they
going
to
the
horse
is
going
to
drive
the
train
is
he
well
I
do
not
think
you
can
darling
you
cannot
have
both
that
and
oh
come
on
this
is
the
real
trailer
for
the
train
is
not
it
here
you
are
do
you
want
horsie
to
go
on
there
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
and
then
you
can
put
that
carriage
on
the
back
there
we
go
had
not
you
better
get
somebody
to
drive
this
train
hmm
what
about
this
little
man
here
does
he
want
to
drive
the
train
Aran
or
is
he
going
to
stand
on
the
back
and
look
after
the
horsie
oh
the
penguin's
driving
the
train
now
is
he
but
there
is
two
little
men
here
can
they
have
a
drive
the
penguins
oh
there
is
somebody
else
here
that
wants
to
drive
the
penguins
are
going
to
do
it
are
they
well
I
am
afraid
he
is
too
tall
that
is
the
trouble
is
not
it
he
is
too
tall
are
you
going
to
have
one
of
those
little
men
in
there
that
is
a
better
idea
I
think
those
little
men'll
be
better
at
driving
than
Pingu
go
on
are
you
driving
them
round
to
Pingu's
igloo
that
man's
riding
the
horse
is
he
oh
he
is
a
clever
man
is
not
he
yes
he
will
if
you
put
him
on
right
you
see
he
is
not
looking
the
right
direction
no
wonder
you
cannot
get
it
on
here
you
are
are
you
driving
them
round
to
the
igloo
then
should
we
make
this
igloo
a
bit
taller
is
that
where
it
goes
hmm
you
are
making
Pingu
feel
at
home
are
you
oh
you
have
dropped
a
brick
in
no
wonder
there
is
not
enough
room
for
Pingu
and
you
want
that
cow
to
go
in
as_well
I
do
not
honestly
think
there
is
enough
room
for
a
cow
in
Pingu'shouse
at
all
the
cow's
going
to
eat
Pingu
and
there
is
a
horse
in
there

is
it
going
to
oh
is
that
the
shark

is
going

eat
dolly
up
whoops
eats
dolly's
toes
up
does
it
oh
poor
dolly
has
she
got
nibbled
toes
now
and
who
is
going
to
make
her
better
those
are
barriers
to
keep
the
animals
in
be
not
they
you
are
keeping
Pingu
in
it
can
go
anywhere
you
like
