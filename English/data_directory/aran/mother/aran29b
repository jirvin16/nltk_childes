little
boy
are
you

nice
little
boy
yes
you
are
be
not
you
you
are
lovely
look
oh
look
there
must
be
some
people
going
for
a
ride
on
the
train
some
coal
well
the
coal
might
go
in
the
tender
on
the
back
but
we
have
not
got
a
tender
to
go
on
the
back
have
we
perhaps
we
could
use
that
and
put
some
coal
in
that
hmm
can
we
use
some
bricks
as
the
coal
little
bricks
do
you
I
do
not
know
where
are
they
going
a
cow
can
go
on
holiday
can
it
is
this
one
going
to
take
its
friend
with
it
well
is
one
called
Daisy
and
the
other
one
called
Buttercup
that
is
a
goat
is
not
it
well
why
oh
you
mean
a
man
a
man
goat
what
are
we
going
to
call
it
Billy
Billie_Goat
Billie_Goat_Gruff
is
that
what
we
are
calling
it
where
are
they
going
on
their
holidays
hmm
you
have
got_to
put
him
in
there
shall
we
build
a
shed
for
the
cows
to
have
their
holiday
in
hmm
how
does
what
make
a
noise
well
the
driver
pulls
the
er
the
little
chain
does
not
he
and
the
whistle
operates
to
let
some
steam
out
it
goes
whoo
does
not
it
how
does
what
well
you
have
just
done
it
you
have
hooked
it
up
have
not
you
hmm
well
I
was
not
aware
you
wanted
some
help
you
usually
tell
me
not
to
bother
you
have
got
it
the
wrong
way
round
have
not
you
that
is
why
you
cannot
hook
it
up
what
is
that
what
is
that
that
you
have
just
put
in
there
hmm
well
there
is
no
room
for
the
cows
if

are
going
to
put
all
that
in
got_to
put
a
roof
on
have
we
right

the
goat
can
go
in
I
think
we
would
better
get
organized
and
get
a
roof
on
then
had
not
we
I
think
it
needs
to
be
a
bit
higher
before
we
put
a
roof
on
I
do
not
think
cows
do
wag
their
tails

get
rid
of
the
flys

crusts
you
do
not

your
crusts
so
your
hair's
straight
well
she
just
opens
her
mouth
and
pops
the
crust
in
and
chews
it
up
then
swallows
well
just
like
you
do
when
you
have

not
special
fences
where

no
what
and
not
Heidi
do
not
you
like
Heidi
oh
that
is
a
surprise
does
not
sound
as
though
you
do
I
think
you
I
think
you
are
just
one
short
Aran
if
you
move
that
one
up
one
then
you
have
got
enough
have
not
you
to
put
that
down
like
that
there
is
a
special
fence
to
stop
people
getting
in
to
the
igloo
oh
well
that
makes
it
doubly
safe
does
not
it
stops
people
getting
in
to
the
igloo
stops
people
getting
near
the
igloo
does
not
it
are
there
any
more
oh

I
think
perhaps
you
would
better
put
that
one
out
as_well
oh
that
is
a
good
idea
if
you
put
it
there
stops
people
coming

does
not
it
there
is
another
one
here
are
you

hmm
what
other
one
what
other
fence
goes
where
here

of
the
others

think
there
only
are
four
fences
be
not
there
so
you
would
have_to
move
one
oh
is
that
a
snake
outside
that
is
going
to
frighten
people

was
a
snake
or
a
tiger
to
frighten
people
off

is
a
good
idea
is
not
it
that
is
