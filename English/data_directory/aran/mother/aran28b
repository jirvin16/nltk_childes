build
a
great
big
tower
up
oh
look
there
is
a
bit
more
a
bit
more
to
that
train
is
not
it
what
are
we
going
to
build
are
we
going
to
build
a
farm
right
for
Pingu
where
is
Pingu
living
at
the
moment
in
the
North_Pole
still
or
South_Pole
it
is
is
not
it
right
we
would
better
have
a
blue
farmhouse
then
for
Pingu
are
you
coming
to
help
me
Pingu's
igloo
is
that
what
it
is
got_to
be
oh
Aran
I
do
not
think
Pingu
has
a
horse
to
ride
I
think
Pingu
has
a
sledge
right
here
we
are
this
is
Pingu's
sledge
that
is
one
of
its
runners
is
not
it
that
can
be
the
door
perhaps
we
would
better
have
a
blue
door
well
everything
in
the
South_Pole
is
blue
because
it
is
cold
it
is
either
blue
because
it
is
cold
or
it
is
white
because
it
is
snowy
do
you
agree
you
agree
well
that
is
green
not
blue
now
do
not
throw
it
is
only
a
way
of
talking
well
it
does
not
look
like
a
way
of
talking
to
me
come
on
you
find
me
some
more
blue
bricks
I
think
this
is
all
going
to
be
rather
difficult
because
I
think
this
horse
is
rather
tall
do
not
you
he
is
too
big
to
ride
is
he
right
this
is
Pingu's
