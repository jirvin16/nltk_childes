good
story
about
thick
snow
all
the
roads
were
blocked
and
every
body
was
digging
out
were
not
they
had
to
dig
the
snow
away

get
to
their
front
doors
oh
look
there
is
two
big
black
there
well
I
do
not
know
what
they
would
be
eating
because
there
is
so
much
snow
on
the
ground
is
not
there
there
would
not
be
much
for
them
to
eat
would
there
perhaps
somebody
put
some
bread
out
on
the
lawn
for
them
you
put
some
bread
out
on
the
lawn
