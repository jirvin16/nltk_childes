this
is
where
the
shark
fits
right
what
are
you
going
to
build
out_of
this
lego
hmm
I
will
tell
you
what
that
train
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
I
tell
you
what
we
are
going
to
build
some
shark
nets
here
so_that
he
shark
does
not
come
into
land
does
it
so
it
cannot
get
men
on
their
surf
boards
take
that
man
out
he
cannot
drive
the
train
why
not
is
this
the
circus
train
is
it
the
circus
is
coming
to
town
well
all
right
Bumbo
can
go
on
this
side
perhaps
we
will
dispense
with
the
shark
shall
we
have
an
enclosure
for
the
animals
while
they
are
resting
before
they
have_to
go
into
the
circus
do
you
remember
when
we
went

the
sort
of
behavior
we
expect
is
it
is
that
going
in
the

in
with
their
hay
what
do
you
think
that
is
the
medicine
is

they
dead
they
are
dead
are
they
well
where

we
going
to
take
them
then
are
we
going
to
bury
them
well
where
are
you
going
to
bury
them
in
this
box
shall
we
make
a
little
box
out_of
lego
where
you
can
bury
them
somebody's
been
making
something
nice
out_of
this
lego
have
not
they
look
at
that
that
is
smart
is
not
it
is
this
the
box
here
where
you
are
going
to
bury
them
or
shall
we
build
a
box
out_of
our
bricks
that
might
be
easier
then
we
can
put
a
lid
on
it
cannot
we
you
are
making
a
what
a
hospital
or
a
box
a
box
right
are
you
putting
animals
in
this
box
our
box
has
only
got
one
side
though
we
need
more
sides
than
that
for
a
box
do
not
you
come
on
let
us
make
that
one
of
the
sides
there
is
a
bit
more
crash
all
those
chickens
going
in
the
box
as_well
right
right
well
we
have
got
chickens
we
have
got
a
cow
is
this
horse
in
the
box
you
want
to
take
the
horse
do
you
where
are
you
taking
the
horse
are
you
taking
it
back
to
the
enclosure
where
the
animals
are
oh
it
is
parked
has
it
it
is
going
in
now
is
it
is
this
because
its
leg
was
so
sore
are
all
the
animals
going
in
this
box
there
well
what
is
it
then
the
back
door's
just
there
is
it
why
do
not
you
do
a
bit
of
building
with
this
lego
yourself
instead
of
leaving
it
all
to
me
oh
you
want
to
build
it
now
well
you
have
just
pulled
it
all
to
pieces
are
you
going
to
build
it
back
up
again
is
there
enough
room
in
there
you
have
got
some
holes
in
your
walls
are
those
for
windows
oh
what
is
that
on
top
of
the
train
there
you
are
oh
cannot
he
stand
up
so
there
is
more
room
is
there
room
for
the
horse
or
are
you
taking
the
horse
well
you
are
going
to
have_to
pile
them
up
be
not
you
I
think
they
are
just
about
all
right
are
they
well
it
might
go
on
it
might
not
it
might
slide
off
are
these
all
bodys
are
they
all
alive
or
are
they
dead
this
lot
well
I
think
you
could
put
the
sheep
in
round
here
perhaps
because
there
is
just
a
little
bit
more
room
is
not
there
where
are
you
taking
them
all
the
hens
have_to
go
in
well
go
on
put
the
hens
down
there
right
there
you
are
they
are
all
in
all
aboard
all
aboard
the
circus
train
where
are
they
going
oh
you
have
had
a
crash
well
would
not
it
be
easier
if
perhaps
we
took
this
out
and
there
would
be
more
room
would
not
there
are
you
going
to
put
the
horse
right
