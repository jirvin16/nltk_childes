I
think
we
would
better
put
your
animals
out_of
the
way
I
know
they
are
not
the
same
as
Anna's
but
we
do
not
really
want
to
get
Anna's
mixed
up
with
ours
Anna's
are
probably
better
than
yours
on
second
thoughts
perhaps
we
do
want
to
that
is
called
panda's
shirt

does
not
go

a
better
builder
than
mummie

you

that
is
it
is
not
it
Pingu's
igloo
and
Pingu
and
his
friend
Pingo
are

are
you
putting
those
hens
in
there
be
not
you
afraid
they
are
going
to
freezer
to
death
it
is
very
cold
at
the
south
pole
is
not
it
pardon
now
if
you
are
too
strong
on
it
Aran
it
will
collapse
where
do
you
want
that
to
go
right
on
the
top
let
us
have
it
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
there
we
are
that
is
Pingu's
igloo
what
are
we
going
to
do
now
is
this
this
little
man
that
comes
along
zzz
with
that
sort
of
little
electric
car
and
takes
people
all
about
on
the
snow
do
you
remember
when
Pingu
went
to
that
sort
of
museum
well
that
picture
gallery
where
they
had
those
sculptures
and
those
pictures
and
Pingu
and
Robbie
upset
one
of
the
sculptures
did
not
they
and
all
that
that
one
that
was
a
mother
and
baby
fell
to
pieces
did
not
it
and
they
rearranged
it
to
be
a
horse
do
you
remember
that
one
you
said
you
did
not
like
that
one
you
do
I
thought
you
did
not
mhm
right
what
is
happening
in
Pingu's
igloo
is
he
having
a
party
why
are
they
having
a
party
is
it
somebody's
birthday
how
old
is
he
twenty
I
did
not
know
Pingu
was
that
old
I
really
did
not
I
thought
he
was
younger
than
that
are
you
sure
I
thought
that
Pingu
was
younger
than
that
because
Pingu
still
goes
to
school
does
not
he
so
how
can
he
be
twenty
if
if
he
is
going
to
school
because
he
just
wants
to
right
so
is
he
having
a
cake
with
twenty
candles
on
he
wants
to
go
in
in
the
snow
does
he
Pingo
I
suppose
so
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
right
where
are
they
going
are
they
going

that
picture
gallery
again
are
they
or
are
they
going
fishing
or
have
they
got
their
sledges
with
them
are
they
going
swimming
are
you
sure
you
get
sharks
at
the
south
pole
hmm
oh
you
have
saved
Pingu
and
Pingo
have
you
by
dealing
with
the
shark
oh
I
think
they

better
go
home
now
for
a
cup
of
tea
I
think
they
have
both
been
very
frightened
have
not
they
by
that
shark
oh
Pingu
is
being
brave
is
not
he
has
he
dealt
with
that
shark
now
hmm

make
his
igloo

fall
down

take
what
you
want

what
both
the
green
and
the
red

a
funny
collection
of

not
look
like

igloo
at
all
now
does
it
what
does
it
look
like
a
church
is
it
with
a
steeple
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
it
is
all
going
to
come
down
that
is
it
is
it
a
church
with
a
steeple
and
another
steeple
are
the
witches
going
to
fly
around
your
steeples
oh

on
I
will
hold
the
bottom
oh

that
the
spire
on

a
very
funny
shaped
steeple
this
is
very
funny
indeed
is
that
the
lightening
conductor
at
the
top
oh
dear
oh
I
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
took
that
one
off
would
not
it
looks
more
like
a
crane
than
a
steeple
to
me
is
that
oh

you
have
not
got
it
in
the
right
place
Aran
as
a
temporary
measure

you
were
warned
were
not
you
let

start
again
right
come
on
we
can
go
on
now
cannot
we
see
how
high
we
can
get
it
what
color's
that
one
I
thought
it
might
be
no
you
need
to
pull
it
a
bit
nearer
to
you
Aran
there
we
are
is
that
it

over
there
but
can
you
put
them
back
now
Aran
well
you
are
a
big
boy
now
and
I
think
you
should
be
able
to
put
them
back
you
should
be
able
to
tell
which
is
the
biggest
one
and
put
them
back
on
in
order
should
not
you
which
is
the
biggest

is
one
bigger
than
that
