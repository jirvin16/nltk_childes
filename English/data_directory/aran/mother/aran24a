Missis_Goggins

is
Missis_Goggins
look
there

can
you
find
her
Missis_Goggins

about
some
letters

the

is
not
it

that
Missis_Goggins
we
will
put
Missis_Goggins
behind
the
counter
should
we
oh
I
do
look

she
is
in
the
in
the
is
not
she
well
if
we
put
her
beside
the
counter
like
that
then
we
have
got
some
room

are
you

I
thought
it
might
be
nice
to
read
the
book
at
the
same
time
as
playing
with
the
fuzzy
felt
because
when
we
played
with
the
fuzzy
felt
before
it
did
not
really
work
did
it
because
we
did
not
well
we
did
not
really
make
up
a
story
about

did
we
so
I
thought
if

join
Mummy
stop
wrecking
my
chair
as_well
come

course
you
can
can
you
see
Jess
anywhere
here
well
you
have
not
looked
very
hard
I
can
see
Jess
now
there
she
is
right
what
a_lot_of
cards
and
letters
said
Pat
that
is
because
it
is
Mother's
day
on
Sunday
said
Missis_Goggins
oh
said
Pat
I
would
forgotten
I
would
better
get
a
card
for
my
old
Mother

a
nice
present

Missis_Goggins
I
wonder

have
not
got
a
Missis_Pottage
have
we
oh
dear
oh
never
mind
let
us
forget
Missis_Pottage
oh
dear
this
is
not
going
to
work
very
well
because
we
have
not
got
Missis_Pottage
and
we
have
not
got
a
Doctor_Gilbertson
either
so
we
will
go
on
to
Ted_Glen

he
is
there

Ted_Glen

what
a
church
whoops
there
we
are

you

that
is
a

oh

it
might
be
a
girl
if
you
want
a
young
lady
or
a
girl
go
on
then
yes
there
we
are
that
is
the
right
one
is
not
it
shows
that
she
is
waiting
for
the
train
does
not
it
is
that
the
telephone
box
on
the
station
you
do
not
think
so
why
not
look
here
is
that
lady's
suitcase
is
she
going
to
have
it
in
her
hand
where
is
she
going
on
her
holidays

will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
well
is
not
the
beach
going
on
holiday
oh
right
well
we
will
have_to
remember
that
going
to
the
beach
is
not
going
on
holiday
right
are
we
putting
this
carriage
on
whoops
lady's
is
her
suitcase
going
in
there
what
is
inside
her
suitcase
why
not
why
not
why
be
not
I
allowed
to
know
what
is
in
her
suitcase
hmm
oh
it
is
knocked
it
over
because
it
was
in
the
way
of
the
carriage
was
not
it
so
the
carriage
just
kept
going
where
is
this
train
going
to
where
is
it
going
to
Scotland
Aran
is
it
are
you
planing
a
derailment
well
I
do
not
think
it
will
work
like
that
it
did
not
go
the
wrong
way
at
all
oh
dear
one
of
the
wheels
is
off
the
track
is
not
it
was
that
what
you
wanted
oh

the
train
are
you
trying
to
get
your
fingers
run
over
well
I
am
going
to
build
another
bridge
why
because
I
think
a
train
should
go
under
a
bridge
it
usually
gives
a
great
big
whistle
before
it
goes
under
the
bridge
it
is
going
is
not
it
we
could
have
a
level
crossing
like
there
is
in
that
Gumdrop
book
could
not
we
a
crossing
there
we
are
oh
poor
train
you
have
derailed
it
now
have
not
you
shall
we
bring
this
freight
train
shall
we
I
do
not
know
whether
you
can
hook
it
up
to
that
one
I
do
not
think
so
you
cannot
hook
it
up
to
that
one
I
am
sure
look
here
is
a
freight
train
coming
along
what
is
it
bringing
hmm
what
is
in
these
round
ones
are
these
drums
what
are
they
full
of
where
is
the
freight
train
going
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
because
it
will
crash
into
it
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
are
you
going
to
tell
Anna
about
that
train
that
you
went
on
at
the
fair
what
else
did
you
go
on
you
want
to
look
in
the
suitcase
see
if
there
is
anything
in
it
right
well
let
me
do
it
for
you
if
you
cannot
do
it
it
is
very
simple
really
it
is
just
that
your
fingers
be
not
quite
long
enough
there
we
are
I
am
afraid
I
am
afraid
she
has
not
got
anything
in
her
suitcase
what
do
you
think
she
should
have
had
to
go
on
holiday
do
you
think
she
should
have
put
a
bucket
and
spade
in
there
what
else
a
swimsuit
what
about
a
towel
for
when
she
gets
dressed
afterwards
and
some
Cheese_ets
anything
else
what
about
a
drink
of
orange
juice
that
would
be
nice
would
not
it
is
that
what
you
have
when
you
go
swimming
hmm
you
did
get
your
trousers
wet
did
not
you
what
is
going
on
now
are
you
going
to
put
that
suitcase
back
on
the
train
only
you
will
have
the
station
master
out_of
that
train
in
a
minute
to
find
out
what
is
happening
hmm
that
is
him
he
is
going
to
get
out
any
minute
now
and
he
is
going
to
say
my
goodness
me
what
is
going
on
with
this
train
why
has
it
stopped
like
this
in_between
stations
because
here
is
the
station
the
train
should
not
stop
outside
the
station
should
it
has
it
stopped
because
that
bridge
is
dangerous
how
is
it
dangerous
is
it
going
to
fall
down
no
you
are
going
to
knock
it
down
are
you
oh
dear
oh
well
that
is
all
right
Aran
because
the
track's
quite
clear
now
we
have
had
the
demolition
man
in
the
train
can
go
in
cannot
it
because
the
track's
quite
clear
nothing
on
the
track
is
there
because
the
demolition
man
yourself
has
knocked
it
all
over
and
there
is
none
of
it
left
on
the
track
build
it
up
again
what
so
you
can
knock
it
down
I
do
not
think
that
is
a
very
good
idea
which
little
boy
yes
well
yes
he
has
it
is
a
rather
nice
train
that
is
not
it
is
it
like
yours
well
it
is
like
yours
but
if
you
have
a
look
he
is
done
things
differently
has
not
he
hmm
he
has
not
got
his
train
like
yours
we
have
lost
the
stop
sign
as_well
you
and
Daddy
have
mixed
it
all
up
have
not
you
you
have
got
bones
and
no
stop
sign
well
that
is
what
I
would
like
to
know
looks
as
though
it
is
gone
forever
if
you
ask
me
unless
that
is
it
no
I
cannot
find
any
stop
sign
at
all
only
phone
and
train
where
that
is
not
the
stop
sign
the
stop
sign
says
stop
just
like
this
oh
yes
that
is
it
there
you
are
that
is
the
right
one
stop
as
this
train's
in
danger
shall
we
take
that
down
like
that
and
we
will
put
a
big
stop
sign
up
here
right
in
the
middle
of
the
track
so_that
the
train
cannot
get
past
see
dangerous
close
the
track
to
the
train
closed
the
track
have
not
we
stop
it
says
the
station
master
has_to
stop
not
does
not
he
because
it
says
stop
and
the
station
master
daren't
go
on
because
it
might
be
dangerous
might
not
it
hmm
no
I
am
not
surprised
oh
dear
me
well
that
was
not
very
good
was
it
well
I
do
not
think
I
am
not
sure
that
stop
sign'll
go
on
properly
I
think
it
will
just
push
it
out_of
the
way
just
like
that
you
have_to
be
a
bit
have
a
better
stop
there
you
are
try
that
no
that
was
not
big
enough
either
was
it
are
you
going
to
put
your
train
on
there
well
get
it
get
it
on
the
rails
properly
Aran
you
either
stop
it
do
not
or
not
you
do
not
hold
it
what
are
you
doing
now
well
I
do
not
know
that
it
will
darling
you
can
try
if
you
want
let
us
just
try
this
bit
like
that
let
us
move
that
up
a
bit
there
we
are
shall
we
try
oh
I
think
it
is
a
bit
too
heavy
for
it
to
pull
it
is
struggling
is
not
it
no
I
think
we
would
better
not
because
we
might
spoil
it
might
not
we
we
might
spoil
it
well
I
know
but
it
is
it
is
I
think
it
is
too
heavy
is
not
it
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
hmm
well
I
tell
you
what
we
could
unload
this
freight
and
put
it
on
the
train
could
not
we
shall
we
do
that
hmm
shall
we
take
the
passengers
out
and
take
the
luggage
out
we
have
unloaded
it
have
not
we
now
right
are
you
going
to
put
all
the
freight
in
there
what
are
these
hmm
great
barrels
of
chemicals
if
you
leave
it
open
the
top
open
like
that
we
can
get
more
in
cannot
we
what
is
that
is
that
a
plank
of
planks
of
wood
great
planks
of
wood
and
what
is
that
I
thought
it
might
be
some
hay
or
something
like
that
well
let
us
try
one
of
these
little
square
ones
they
might
go
in
instead
put
the
little
ones
in
come
on
let
us
put
them
in
oh
Aran
you
cannot
put
the
top
down
because
if
you
put
the
top
down
there
is
not
enough
room
for
all
the
things
you
have
put
in
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
right
okay
is
that
enough
enough
freight
where
is
it
going
is
not
it
going
to
the
chemical
factory
the
lady's
going
in
too
well
I
do
not
think
she
will
be
too
pleased
about
that
will
she
it
is
hardly
a
holiday
to
go
in
with
a_lot_of
barrels
and
things
mhm
I
think
the
batterys
are
running
out
be
not
they
actually
sounds
as
though
it
is
struggling
a
bit
er
Aran
if
you
do
that
the
battery
will
not
go
at
all
the
battery
will
run
out
completely
and
the
train
will
not
go
at
all
I
think
all
this
is
a
bit
heavy
do
not
you
for
the
train
shall
we
take
some
of
it
off
oh
dear
looks
as
though
the
batterys
might
have
given
up
altogether
let
us
take
a
bit
of
this
off
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
is
it
going
uphill
well
I
think
really
you
need
to
stop
it
do
not
you
when
you
are
readjusting
the
er
load
where
is
the
train
for
this
one
hmm
shall
we
build
a
marshalling
yard
to
unload
all
the
er
all
the
freight
we
have
bought
all
the
great
big
drums
of
chemicals
and
things
should
we
right
here
we
are
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
right
come
on
then
well
you
do
not
need
to
take
the
train
off
the
rails
do
you
what
happens
is
that
you
just
no
you
leave
it
all
on
the
rails
Aran
and
what
happens
is
things
like
great
big
diggers
and
forklift
trucks
come
along
and
they
lift
these
things
out
like
that
do
not
they
and
then
they
store
them
well
I
do
not
know
where
your
digger
is
let
us
go
and
find
that
little
crane
next
and
see
if
that'll
lift
these
things
off
I
think
that
is
perhaps
the
right
size
there
you
are
you
can
measure
the
track
with
that
cannot
you
Aunty_Kate
gave
it
to
you
did
not
she
right
come
on
let
us
get
these
unloaded
here

the
arm
of
the
oh
I
do
not
think
it
is
quite
big
enough
is
it
we
will
just
have_to
pretend
it
is
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
oh
come
on
the
great
big
one
right
okay
you
let
your
crane
get
them
out
right
come
on

is
your
crane

there
is
the
stuff
in
there

the
crane

your
hand
what
more
do
you
want
that
is
the
crane

not

crane

think

only
actually
have
one
crane
do
not

with
a
bucket
like
that
well
which
one
do
you
want
which
