why

a
sausage
it

you
do
with
it
did
you
eat

was
it
tasty
very

well
you
are
the
first
person
I
know
that
says
a
plastic
sausage
is
tasty
right
where
is
Pingu
well
if
you
think
you
need
a
man
on
the
roof
yes
oh
that
looks
good
does
not
it
please
will
you
move
your
hand
is
what
you
say
right
well
we
will
build
a
bit
more
of
the
roof
then
should
we
this
bit
well
just
be
careful
Aran
or
else
it
will
break
because
it
is
not
very
strong
that
is
the
front
off
the
train
so
it
is
not
likely
to
go
on
the
roof
is
it
hmm
the
barriers
there
is
Pingu
is
Pingu
going
in
and
his
friend
who
is
his
friend
there
you
are
that
is
Pinga
right
have
you
got
another
barrier
to
put
over
the
front
well
if
you
stood
them
both
up
you
would
do
a
lot
better
would
not
you
there
would
be
space
for
them
both
well
you
find
it
it
is
in
there
somewhere
you
turned
everything
out
did
not
you
I
can
see
one
now
what
do
you
need
one
at
the
back
for
to
stop
everybody
coming
through
the
garden
what
sort
of
people
are
you
expecting
some
baddies
and
what
are
they
going
to
do
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
Pingu
what
are
they
going
to
do
to
him
smash
him
well
there
is
another
one
is
not
there
well
there
was
can
you
find
it
right
well
put
it
across
there
then
well
that
is
not
very
well
fixed
is
it
all
right
then
here
you
are
what
are
you
doing
now
putting
some
more
on
right
there
you
are
it
is
making
the
roof
stronger

need
a
little
one
to
go
there
do
not
you
or
you
could
put
that
one
on
top
there
that
is
right

is
a
bit
long
Aran
