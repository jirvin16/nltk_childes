he
he
did
say
I
am
sinking
and
along
came
Benny_the_breakdown_truck
to
save
the
day
did
not
he
and
he
drove
all
the
way
up
on
to
the
bridge
did
not
he
whee
and
he
dangled
his
hook
over
the
edge
and
it
just
managed
to
catch
it
now
if
you
are
not
careful
this
bridge
is
going
to
collapse
he
just
managed
to
dangle
it
and
get
hold
of
Alfie's
bumper
and
pulled
him
up
and
Alfie
was
dripping
wet
and
there
were
all
fish
hanging
off
him
were
not
there
hmm
and
did
he
tow
him
back
to
the
garage
let
us
tow
him
back
to
the
garage
here
we
are
see
if
we
can
get
that
that
is
right
is
not
it
there
we
are
are
you
taking
him
back
to
the
garage
because
his
spark
plugs
have
got_to
be
dried
out
have
not
they
well
he
is
not
reached
the
garage
yet
has
he
oh
there
there
goes
the
bridge
oh
there
we
are
here
is
poor
Francis
here
is
poor
Alfie
you
would
better
put
him
on
the
ramp
so_that
Mike_mechanic
can
have
a
look
underneath
well
he
is
going
up
and
down
like
a
yoyo
is
not
he
right
we
will
slide
Mike
underneath
so
he
can
see
what
is
happening
and
then
we
will
get
him
to
have
a
look
at
the
engine
and
dry
the
spark
plugs
off
well
that
was
not
a
very
bright
idea
you
have
gone
and
squashed
Mike
now
have
not
you
how
is
he
going
to
look
under
the
bonnet
if
you
do
that
right
there
you
are
come
on
we
got
this
off
the
ramp
everything
seems
to
be
all
right
under
there
does
not
it
open
the
bonnet
dry
off
the
spark
plugs
and
there
is
Alfie
just
ready
I
think
you
would
better
put
him
through
the
carwash
because
he

covered
in
dirty
bits
of
water
from
the
um
from
the
canal
and
he
is
got
a
fish
sticking
in
him
and
he
is
got
some
weed
on
him
as_well
come
on
put
him
through
the
carwash
you
have
got_to
put
him
further
forward
that
is
right
I
think
he
is
a
bit
too
thin
actually
never
mind
he
is
a
sports
car
right
is
he
nice
and
dry
and
clean
and
fresh
now
it
is
Benny's
turn
I
thought
he
was
going
to
say
thank_you
to
Benny
for
being
so
kind
as
to
rescue
him
and
saving
his
life
is
he
going
to
well
what
an
ungrateful
sports
car
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
right
you
put
him
through
the
carwash
then
is
he
out
the
other
end
that
is
why
Benny
had
what
Benny's
truck
was
wet
why
he
pulled
Alfie
out_of
the
river
did
he
that
is
why
Benny
got
wet
well
Benny
did
not
go
in
the
river
did
he
no
he
did
not
he
just
dangled
his
hook
over
the
edge
of
the
bridge
it
is
in
that
book
over
there
I
will
show
you
only
one
person
got
wet
and
that
was
Alfie
look
here
we
are
it
is
that
man
next
is
not
it
there
is
not
a
blue
anywhere
the
blue
died
look
there
you
are
there
is
Alfie
going
down
towards
the
canal
is
not
there
is
not
he
look
and
there
he
is
going
in
the
canal
with
a
great
big
splash
come
on
here
is
Benny
getting
Alfie
out_of
the
river
out_of
the
canal
are
you
looking
here
look
it
is
Alfie
that
is
wet
through
how
could
Benny
get
wet
hmm
oh
look
there
is
Benny
pulling
Alfie
home
look
at
all
the
water
coming
off
Alfie
have
you
charged
up
Alfie's
battery
well
do
not
you
think
you
better
had
do
because
if
it
is
got
wet
it
might
not
be
working
properly
he
is
going
in
the
river
again
is
he
who
is
going
to
rescue
him
this
time
do
you
think
Benny
wants
to
build
the
bridge
up
what
about
you
building
the
bridge
up
oh
I
thought
it
would
be
me

new
one
