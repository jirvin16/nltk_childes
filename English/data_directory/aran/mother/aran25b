these

I

have
caught
a
chill
have
not
they
it
is
been
very
wet
and
very
rainy
and
the
farmer
forgot
to
put
them
into
the
barn
at
night
did
not
he
that
is
the
vet
is
not
it
it
is
not
the
farmer
now
these
two
pigs
have
not
been
very
well
either
because
they
have
eaten
something
that
is
disagreed
with
them
so
they
are
feeling
a
bit
sick
be
not
they
come
on
and
here
is
the
farmer
riding
along
on
his
horse
he
is
not
a
very
good
farmer
is
he
if
he
lets
his
animals
get
sick
like
this
is
he
Old_McDonald
no
come
on
you
eat
that
up
quickly
now
please
and
these
chickens
he
is
having
a
look
at
these
chickens
because
they
have
not
been
laying
any
eggs
and
this
dog
has
got
a
poorly
foot
he
is
trodden
on
some
glass
and
cut
his
foot

did
not
he
and
it
hurt
him
and
it
started
bleeding
did
not
it
and
this
horse
has
just
got
its

that
the
horse
and
the
foal
are
all
right
is
not
he
and
here
is
some
more
of
those
nonlaying
chickens
