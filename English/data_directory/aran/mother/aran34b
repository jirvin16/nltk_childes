is
a
bar
of

would
better
use
one
of
these
smaller
ones
as
a
bar
of
soap
give
Master_Tubby
a
nice
wash
I
thought
you
said

him
what
are
you
doing

have
been
very
dirty
if

me
exactly
point
with
your

that
one
that
big
toe
were

they
long
enough
well
it
is
costing
me
an
awful
lot
of
money
this
is
all
these
new
shoes
every
time
you
get
a
pair
of
shoes
on
your
feet
you
say
they
do
not
fit
you
what
about
those
Wellingtons
do
they
fit
you
where
do
they
hurt
you
in
the
body
of
the
shoe
are
they
all
right
on
your
legs
a
little
boy
well
I
do
not
know
who
he
is
it
could
be
you
yes
have
we
finished
measuring
feet
then
and
getting
new
shoes
hmm
get
the
what
it
is
over
here
is
not
it
what
are
we
going
to
build
a
barn
what
color
are
we
going
to
have
what
color
are
barns
they
are
usually
red
barns
be
not
they
with
yellow
roofs
shall
we
have
a
red
barn
well
that
is
blue
now
if
you
do
four
sides
like
that
how
is
anybody
going
to
get
in
well
come
on
you
know
how
to
put
a
roof
on
Daddy's
showed
you
how
to
put
a
roof
on
last
time
you
played
with
him
you
are
always
putting
roofs
on
things
and
building
things
be
not
you
those
are
the
steps
up
well
I
am
not
sure
that
farmers
usually
have
steps
up
to
the
barn
because
Aran
if
you
have
steps
up
to
the
barn
how
is
the
tractor
going
to
drive
in
right
okay
I
do
not
think
that
is
very
sensible
though
do
you
hmm
I
do
not
believe
that
for
one
minute
you
are
very
good
at
saying
people
have
told
you
to
do
things
be
not
you
I
reckon
that
was
a
porkie
is
it
no
well
course
not
course
not
my
son
would
not
tell
a
porkie
would
he
no
you
would
not
tell
a
story
would
you
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
funny
barn
well
there
seem
to
be
more
things
in
it
than
out
come
on
we
need
some
more
of
these
big
bricks
do
not
we
to
make
a
roof
have
you
got
any
more
big
bricks
oh
there
is
a
white
one
well
we
have
not
got
much
a
roof
really
today

we
because
it
is
broken
now
oh
dear
it
is
falling
to
pieces
is
not
it
perhaps
if
we
did
it
that
way
instead
maybe
a
little
bit
oh
dear
all
falling
to
bits
now
is
not
it
like
china
clay
what
is
like
china
clay
why
does
china
clay
break
easily
is
it
china
clay
that
Thomas_the_Tank_Engine

the
harbor

his

behave
themselves

they
that
is
not
very
nice
is
it
poor
Thomas

he
get
bruises
on
the
back
of
his
er
fenders
oh

handcuffs
Aran

have
repaired
them
by
now
did
you
have
a_lot_of
knocking
and
banging
to
do
when

you
do
a_lot_of
rubbing
down

painting
a_lot_of
polishing

it
take
you

think

them
