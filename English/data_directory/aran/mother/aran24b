where

the
big
wheel
no
but
this
one
has
a
big
wheel
does
not
it
at
the
back
yes
where
is
the
little
wheel
and
what
have
we
got
here
what
is
this
is
that
the
engine
right
is
the
tractor
going
round
the
farm
with
the
dog
on
what
is
it
going
to
pick
up
hay
is
this
for
the
chickens
well
who
does
eat
hay
then
hmm
is
it
coming
into
the
barn
all
right
well
take
everything
out_of
the
barn
you
take
the
tractor
into
the
barn
there
is
lots_of
hay
in
the
back
is
there
right
that
is
jolly
good
is
not
it
are
you
going
to
take
some
of
the
hay
out
for
the
animals
hmm
who
is
hopping
is
it
the
dog
or
is
it
the
little
boy
hmm
well
do
you
want
me
to
stand
him
up
properly
for
you
oh
he
is
he
is
he
is
only
a
little
dog
really
is
not
he
shall
we
stand
him
up
there
that
is
right
is
not
it
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
well
because
when
the
tractors
move
too
quickly
it
lurches
and
people
do
fall
over
do
not
they
pardon
what
is
in
the
way
that
snake
did
you
move
it
out_of
the
way
you
could
not
get
past
the
snake
so
you
had
to
move
it
out_of
the
way
did
you
right
I
see
oh
the
roof
of
the
cab's
falling
off
you
would
better
put
that
back
quickly
because
it
can
be
dangerous
if
you
have
got
a
tractor
without
a
cab
like
that
you
know
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
when
it
rains
well
if
it
rolls
over
the
man
the
man
who
is
sitting
driving
it
might
get
crushed
might
not
he
if
there
is
nothing
to
protect
him
what
is
it
then
we
are
pretending
it
is
a
what
what
do
you
think
it
is
well
I
should
imagine
one
of
the
other
little
boys
built
it
what
shall
we
pretend
it
is
hmm
what
do
you
think
it
is
a
castle
you
think
you
built
it
did
you
I
am
not
sure
about
that
Aran
all
right
if
you
want
it
to
be
a
castle
shall
we
have
it
as
part
of
a
ruined
castle
on
the
farm
hmm
if
you
stand
it
up
you
can
put
the
animals
to
shelter
behind
it
in
the
rain
oh
dear
go
on
you
stick
it
back
we
will
put
the
animals
to
shelter
behind
it
in
the
rain
well
animals
do
not
like
to
get
too
cold
and
wet
they
always
look
for
a
shelter
in
the
rain
you
do
not
like
standing
outside
in
the
rain
do
you
no
I
thought
not
