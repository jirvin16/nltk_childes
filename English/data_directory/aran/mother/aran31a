new
hen
house
then
if

I
can
can
I
you
are
going
to
let
me
I
am
going
to
have
a
super
hen
house
I
am
going
to
have
lots_of
perches
in
it
for
the
hens
for
them
to
stand
on
I
am
not
sure
I
want
any
help
Aran
I
think
I
could
manage
without
help
oh
it
is
all
right
no
like
what
oh
this
is
a
super
hen
house
lots_of
roosts
for
the
hens
and
lots_of
little
chicks
as_well
I
feed
mine
on
corn
what
do
you
feed
yours
on
oh
do
you
buy
it
from
Bowler's
oh
I
get
mine
from
Bowler's
I
get
these
in
bulk
bulk
from
Bowler's
great
big
sacks
of
it
all
for
my
hens
do
you
feed
them
on
grit
as_well
they
do
they
always
eat
the
grit
because
it
makes
a
nice
shell
the
egg
shells
nice
and
strong
it
does
not
make
them
dirty
why
does
it
make
them
dirty
my
hen
house
is
the
best
hen
house
there
is
ever
been
yes
we
do
not
seem
to
have
all
the
bricks
anymore
do
we
we
seem
to
have
lost
some
we
have
lost
one
of
these
round
blue
ones
have
you
seen
it
no
I
have
not
either
oh
there
it
is
there
you
were
sitting
on
it
well
I
think
that
is
the
best
hen
house
anybody
has
ever
seen
do
not
you
is
Jack_tractor
going
to
knock
it
down
is
Benny_the_breakdown_truck
going
to
knock
it
down
is
Mummy
going
to
knock
it
down
how
do
you
know
I
might
just
decide
that
I
do
not
like
the
look
of
your
hen
house
well
I
might
I
might
decide
it
is
not
grand
enough
for
my
hens
we

better
build
a
new
one
what
are
you
taking
all
the
bricks
off
for
well
we
have
not
decided
yet
whether
this
is
the
best
hen
house
or
not
have
we
oh
you
have
decided
it
is
not
did
you
ask
the
hens
well
you
would
better
start
building
again
had
not
you
right
what
color's
your
hen
house
well
what
color
are
they
oh
you
have
not
got
very
far
Aran
it
is
all
fallen
over
already
going
to
make
another
one
are
you
this
is
going
to
be
rather
a
long
thin
hen
house
is
not
it
where
are
the
hens
going
to
sit
just
on
that
big
one
do
they
know
this
have
you
told
them
oh
I
think
they
have
forgotten
anyway
you
are
building
on
top
of
that
green
one
so
how
can
they
stand
on
it
well
that
was
not
a
very
good
hen
house
was
it
I
think
I
will
build
a
hen
house
of
my
own
no
do
not
bother
I
can
do
without
your
help
in
fact
I
think
it
might
be
easier
if
you
do
not
help
me
do
not
think
much
of
your
hen
house
boy
now
go
and
get
that
brick
please
and
stop
being
silly
all
right
all
right
do
you
not
want
me
to
play
with
them
right
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
right
okay
they
are
your
bricks
be
not
they
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not

I
am
not
going
to
cry
I

you
are
not
being
nice
to
poor
Anna
you
are
being
silly
no
we
do
not
want
you
to
hide
Aran
that
is
the
whole
point
well
as
we
can
see
ninety
percent
of
you
it
is
not
really
very
good
at
hiding
come
on
ask
Anna
who
who
is
the
silliest
boy
that
she
has_to
come
and
see
I

no
you
are
the
naughty
boy
I
shalln't
take
you
out
with
me
again
I
shall
go
out
by
myself
in

I
think
I
will
ask
Daddy
to
take
me
why
not
we
will
leave
you
with
nanny
you
can
stay
with
nanny
for
a
while
well
then
stop
being
silly
all
right
it
is
your
hen
house
you
build
it
why
do
you
particularly
want
a
hen
house
would
not
it
be
better
to
build
a
stable
for
the
horse
had
you
thought
about
that
well
go
on
then
you
build
a
stable
for
the
horse
well
I
think
I
think
we
can
safely
assume
that
we
have
knocked
the
hen
house
down
have
not
we
well
why
did
you
do
it
then
because
you
cannot
help
being
silly
can
you
oh

is
a
jolly
good
hen
house
is
not
it

all
sleep
in
there
can
you
see
why
not
all
right
we
will
fill
the
hole
up
what
are
you
trying
to
do
trying
to
what
you
are
trying
to
make
me
