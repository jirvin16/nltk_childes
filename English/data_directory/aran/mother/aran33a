oh
look
oh
to
wash
Terence
right
okay

we
are
you
would
better
take
Terence
then
had
not
you
I
think
Terence
is
going
in
the
wrong
entrance
there
darling
does
Terence
need
any
diesel
fuel
in
the
back
hmm
oh
well
we
would
better
get
him
filled
up
had
not
we
is
he
tired
after
pulling
Bertie_the_postbus
out_of
the
snow
I
thought
he
would
be
I
thought
to
myself
you
know
when
we
went
when
we
saw
Bertie_the_postbus
coming
back
in
the
snow
I
thought
Terence
is
going
to
be
tired
after
that
job
is
not
he
there
we
are
there
is
the
ramp
is
Terence
going
to
climb
up
the
ramp
gosh
this
is
dusty
Aran
because
we
have
not
been
playing
with
it
have
we
well
I
thought
he
was
going
through
the
carwash
hmm
well
if
Terence
could
come
down
the
ramp
yes
he
is
not
as
good
as
the
other
cars
is
he
because
does
your
nose
want
blowing
it
sounds
as
though
it
does
come
on
come
on
you
wind
Terence
through
the
carwash
explain
to
Terence
what
is
happening
that
he
is
going
through
those
rollers
is
not
he
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
and
have
you
have
you
got
him
through
the
carwash
has
the
egg
come
off
oh
jolly
good
a
bit
has
and
again
that
is
it
that
bit
did
not
well
you
would
better
put
him
through
the
carwash
again
had
not
you
are
you
sure
you
are
operating
this
carwash
properly
I
am
not
convinced
of
this
at
all
right
go
on
has
Terence
has
Terence
been
in
and
what
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
Aran
but
Terence
does
not
use
petrol
Terence
uses
diesel
are
you
sure
you
have
got
the
right
one
out_of
the
right
pump
because
it
is
no
use
putting
unleaded
petrol
into
Terence
when
he
uses
diesel
is
it
are
you
sure
well
I
think
he
is
you
know
all
right
you
try
putting
some
petrol
in
but
do
not
blame
me
if
Terence
breaks
down
will
you
hmm
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
say
that
again
it
is
the
what
the
petrol
he
asked
for
oh
right
go
on
then
is
his
tank
full
how
much
gallons
and
gallons
and
how
much
do
these
gallons
of
petrol
cost
twenty
pounds
worth
of
petrol
got
a
big
tank
has
not
he
now
had
you
better
put
him
through
the
carwash
again
to
make
sure
that
egg's
come
off
him
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
there
we
are
come
on
wind
him
through
oh
come
on
I
think
you
would
better
rub
over
Terence
with
a
window
leather
go
on
I
will
do
it
give
him
a
good
polish
oh
do
you
know
I
think
Terence
is
a
lot
better
now
is
not
he
do
not
you
think
he
looks
nice
and
shiny
no
a
bit
of
egg
on
his
nose
well
are
you
going
to
wipe
it
off
has
he
got_to
go
back
through
the
carwash
again
I
thought
he
might
have
here
is
Terence
he
is
coming
now
oh
that
is
a
modern
tractor
is
not
it
you
see
Terence
is
a
very
old
tractor
is
not
he
that
is
why
he
is
different
what
is
happening
now
the
tractor's
turn
for
what
well
he
is
not
on
the
ramp
is
he
he
is
in
the
car
lift
and
I
think
he
is
just
had
a
serious
accident
by
falling
off
you
have
got_to
be
a
bit
more
careful
have
not
you
or
else
you
are
going
to
get
some
big
compensation
claims
be
not
you
from
the
insurance
it
is
your
negligence
if
they
have
fallen
off
the
car
lift
is
not
there
going
to
be
trouble
Aran
that
is
not
how
you
do
it
is
it
you
know
that
well
that
tractor's
going
to
be
suspended
in
mid
air
it
cannot
get
down
now
can
it
no
nobody
can
reach
it
it
is
just
like
that
time
Bella
got
stuck
in
the
lift
is
not
it
and
what
did
they
do
then
cannot
you
remember
when
Bella
went
shopping
and
Rosa
ran
away
and
Bella
got
locked
in
the
shop
over
night
and
she
thought
that
she
could
get
to
the
entrance
by
using
the
lift
and
all
the
electricity
was
switched
off
was
not
it
and
Bella
was
stuck
in
the
lift

got
it
