flowers

just
one
red
one
Aran
I
think
you
are
imagining
it
mhm
not
made
it
up
all
right
then
I
will
believe
you
come
on
then
come
and
play
look
come
and
put
this
tractor
right
yes
we
can
hear
some
birds
yes
they
might
be
does
not
like
pigeons
no
your
Uncle_John
does
not
like
pigeons
either
does
he
yes
I
do
not
think
he
is
ever
actually
hit
one
but
still
come
on
we
do
not
want
you
to
hide
Aran
we
want
you
to
come
and
play
with
us
no
now
well
that
is
what
you
get
for
being
silly
is
not
it
I
thought
we
were
repairing
the
tractor
I
am
not
sure
you
deserve
to
be
kissed
better
because
you
were
being
silly
right
well
you
put
the
wheel
on
Percy_the_Dexter
you
show
me
how
you
can
do
it
right
where
is
the
wheel
well
you
do
not
leave
all
your
tools
inside
Percy_the_Dexter
do
you
what
have
you
taken
these
wheels
off
for
anyway
come
on
are
we
putting
this
wheel
on
here
did
you
help
Daddy
with
the
wheels
off
Percy_the_tractor
that
is
my
fingers
you
are
banging
right
are
you
sure
we
have
got
the
best
tyres
on
here
have
we
well
it
seems
a
bit
unsafe
to
me
it
looks
a
remarkable
wobbly
wheel
that
does
well
that
is
not
running
at
all
well
is
it
I
think
we
might
have_to
have
another
try
let
us
have
another
go
no
I
think
it
is
going
to
be
a
wobbly
wheel
forever
there
seems
to
be
a
bit
more
clay
on
that
one
does
not
there
than
there
is
on
the
others
let
us
turn
it
upright
and
see
if
it
oh
that
is
all
right
is
not
it
do
not
you
think
well
I
do
not
think
you
are
going
the
right
way
about
it
to
fix
it
Aran
well
I
think
brute
force
is
not
quite
the
answer
is
it
do
not
you
think
you
would
be
a
bit
better
with
a
bit
of
mechanical
expertise
not
again
right
well
is
this
tractor
fixed
then
right
are
we
going
to
have
a
smokestack
on
it
I
am
not
that
is
the
engine
the
seat's
up
there
well
it
is
not
very
useful
to
have
a
smokestack
sticking
out_of
a
seat
is
it
yes
right
you
have
put
it
that
is
a
very
good
idea
shall
we
have
a
a
nut
on
the
bottom
to
stop
it
wobbling
about
you
do
not
want
a
wobbly
smokestack
do
you
are
you
sure
it
quite
needs
that
Aran
right
there
we
go
well
I
think
you
are
banging
it
never
mind
can
you
all
right
that'll
do
now
come
on
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
at
all
right
you
have
fixed
it
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
Farmer_Reed
you
do
not
know
what
do
you
need
a
tractor
for
then
has
it
got
a
bucket
on
it
oh
it
is
got
a
snowplow
on
it
are
you
going
to
er
clear
the
track
up
to
your
farm
get
all
the
snow
off
it
I
am
sure
the
seat's
the
other
side
Aran
I
am
sure
Daddy
intended
the
other
side
to
be
the
seat
I
beg
your
pardon
what
was
all
that
about
pardon
you
have
got
your
tool
yes
it
is
got
no
tools
in
it
though
has
it
hmm
right
what
are
you
doing
now
Farmer_Reed
are
you
er
going
to
put
a
grass
cutter
on
the
back
of
that
or
a
seed
drill
well
you

better
start
thinking
had
not
you
the
day's
going
and
you
have
not
done
much
work
today
have
you
what
have
you
done
were
you
up
early
what
time
yeah
half
past
five
was
it
come
on
have
you
fed
the
chickens
this
morning
did
you
get
many
eggs
how
many
I
am
not
being
rude
Farmer_Reed
but
I
really
think
that
you
ought_to
trade
that
tractor
in
for
a
new
model
because
I
think
that
it
is
not
quite
big
enough
for
you
what
do
you
think
you
do
not
want
to
would
not
you
like
to
trade
Percy_the_Dexter
for
a
brand
new
international
a
red
one
what
about
a
green
one
with
a
muffler
the
muffler
at
the
back
that
magically
went
down
mhm
you
were
not
too
pleased
when
you
did
it
were
you
come
on
what
is
your
next
task
on
the
farm
then
the
sheep
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
sheep
take
all
their
coats
off
when
it
is
sunny
are
you
going
to
shear
them
then
zzz
have
you
got
your
shearing
scissors
ready
so
you
are
not
going
to
do
it
oh
you
think
that
the
sheep
still
need
their
coats
do
you
right
well
then
if
you
are
not
going
to
shear
the
sheep
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
is
your
next
job
on
the
farm
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
the
cows
well
that
is
not
a
job
then
if
you
are
not
doing
anything
is
it
how
about
milking
them
mhm
well
then
you
have
not
got
any
cows
have
you
if
they
have
all
died
what
did
they
die
of
they
ate
something
that
they
sleep
on
I
thought
it
was
guinea
that
did
that
you
have
not
had
any
guinea
at
all
no
Daddy
did
a
long
time
ago
did
it
die
well
come
on
then
what
else
is
there
on
the
farm
for
you
to
look
after
you
have
fed
the
chickens
