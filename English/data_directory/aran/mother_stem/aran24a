can
not
it
because
the

be
there
because
the
demolition
man
yourself
have
knock
it
all
over
and
there
be
none
of
it
left
on
the
track
build
it
up
again
what
so
you
can
knock
it
down
I
do
not
think
that
be
a
very
good
idea
which
little
boy
yes
well
yes
he
have
it
be
a
rather
nice
train
that
be
not
it
be
it
like

but
if
you
have
a
look
he
be
do
thing
different
have
not
he
hmm
he
have
not
get
his
train
like
yours
we
have
lose
the
stop
sign
as_well
you
and
Daddy
have
mix
it
all
up
have
not
you
you
have
get
bone
and
no
stop
sign
well
that
be
what
I
genmod
like
to
know
look
as
though
it
be
go
forever
if
you
ask
me
unless
that
be
it
no
I
can
not
find
any
stop
sign
at
all
only
phone
and
train
where
that
be
not
the
stop
sign
the
stop
sign
say
stop
just
like
this
oh
yes
that
be
it
there
you
be
that
be
the
right
one
stop
as
this
train
be
in
danger
shall
we
take
that
down
like
that
and
we
will
put
a
big
stop
sign
up
here
right
in
the
middle
of
the
track
so_that
the
train
can
not
get
past
see
dangerous
close
the
track
to
the
train
close
the
track
have
not
we
stop
it
say
the
station
master
has_to
stop
not
do
not
he
because
it
say
stop
and
the
station
master
dare
not
go
on
because
it
might
be
dangerous
might
not
it
hmm
no
I
be
not
surprise
oh
dear
me
well
that
be
not
very
good
be
it
well
I
don't
think
I
be
not
sure
that
stop
sign
will
go
on
proper
I
think
it
will
just
push
it
out_of
the
way
just
like
that
you
have_to
be
a
bit
have
a
good
stop

put
your
train
on
there
well
get
it
get
it
on
the
rail
proper

think
it
be
a
bit
too
heavy
for

not
it
no

think
we
genmod

might
not
we
we
might
spoil
it
well
I
know
but
it

it
be
too
heavy
be
not

will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
