there's a freezer
another apple
lots_of grapes
vegetables

you've got_to put the big tins at the bottom and the little tins on top to make a pyramid
so you get another big tin there
and that one
now put that one in the middle
and then you can balance those on top can't you and get a little pyramid
can you put that one on the top
are there any more
oh you're raiding the freezer are you
right
are you going to get your shopping bag and come shopping at my shop
are you
and you'd better get some money
there's some money on there
go and get it
you're not having anything from my shop unless you pay for it properly
it's in that plastic bag
right in front of your nose
well come on

well you've not told me what you want yet
you want a tin of juice do you
right
there you are
that's rather a_lot_of money you've put into my hand isn't it
here you are
you'd better have some change
put it in your shopping basket

you're a very poor customer aren't you if you're only going to buy one little tin of stuff
I want to sell more than that
well would you like my special offer

three
thank_you
here you are
where's your shopping basket
put the pears and the apple in

that's a cabbage darling
cabbage
you're going to cook it are you
you're going to wash it and cut it up and put it in a pan and cook it
your knife's just over there is it
shall Mummy have a look and see where it is
it seems to disappear that knife doesn't it
I don't know what you've done with it this time Aran
oh here we are
there's your knife for chopping cabbage
here you are
better make that into your pan
oh
have you chopped it up
there's your pan

you see I thought we could pretend it was a pan
what do you think
have you lit the gas underneath it
oh is it a birthday tea

now do you need any more provisions from my shop
you're a very good customer you know
I'd be delighted if you came back and bought some more things off me
I'm doing a very good line in tomatos just at present
what would you like
an ice
well please don't eat the goods before you've paid for them

or is it some fish you want
oh well we'd better

would you like a nice piece of shark

I think you might be safer with a tin of salmon to be honest
still
how many shark steaks would you like
right
here you are
a big one and a little one
a big one and a little one
two shark steaks for tea
what are you going to eat with them
that goat's a man

I think it's a nanny goat
which means it's a lady goat
don't you
you don't want to eat it
no
I don't really
I'm not too keen on goat
no
I don't want to eat Jumbo at all
no
I don't
I don't think I fancy elephant steak
mhm

I tell you what Daddy has had
crocodile
no
I haven't got a crocodile
oh well I don't serve snake in my shop
no
that's too dangerous
far too dangerous
no
well you'll have_to do the cutting yourself I'm afraid
I'm not cutting it
oh have you fallen down dead from eating a poisonous snake
it's only a trick
oh right
I see
right
have you finished your shopping or would you like some nice juicy oranges for your breakfast tomorrow morning
have you got a pussycat
have you got a dog
oh well perhaps Margaret and Mary would like a tin of dog food for their dog wouldn't they
oh the dog food's down here at the bottom
there we are
a tin of Pal
very nice tin of dog food
but it does come rather expensive
you can give it to Mary's doggy
yes you can
what's it called
for what
Abbie its name was
not Rookie
Abbie
Abbie's not out at the moment darling
she retired indoors with a bone half an hour ago
yes well Margaret took one out_of the freezer for her didn't she
yes he has
that's why he stopped barking
he's got a bone
did you like that dog
I haven't got a bone
no
I don't usually eat bones
a penguin bone
I thought penguins were biscuits
you want to eat it do you
what do you want me to do with it
a
it's Pingu
you can't eat Pingu can you
you're pretending to eat him
oh you naughty Norman_Price
you just wait until I get hold of you
I'm coming to get you now
Norman_Price

I think we'll have you doing some jobs
I think we'll have you sweeping up in my shop
oh you've got a ready answer for everything haven't you
oh don't bother
don't bother
come on
shall we have a look at these animals
no
we don't do that
no
that's not nice Aran

can you balance them
calm down
and balance one on top of the other
what are those
come on Mister_silly
what are these anyway that you've just eaten
grapes
they are
were they seedless
no
don't jump on things please
are they seedless ones then
Aran
you know that they're supposed to be washed before you eat them don't you
oh I don't respond to that
you're going to be very poorly aren't you
with all those pesticides and things on the outside of the fruit and vegetables that you haven't washed up
right well I think we'll conclude our shopping expedition
should we
I think I'm going to tidy up in my shop
I don't think I'll let that naughty Aran_Reed back into my shop again
I think he's a very unpleasant creature
now
it's not yours
now you behave yourself please
no
you behave yourself
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
what's Daddy told you

what are you going to sell me
well what is that
a what
come on
can I have that apple please
because I want to buy it
I want it very cheaply though with teeth marks in it
no
you can't open tins with your teeth Aran
come on
I think I would like some eggs please
are you going to be the cheese man and sell me some eggs
oh Aran
do stop being so silly
really
yes
I do want some eggs please
are you going to put them in the egg box for me so they don't get broken
think think think think think think think think think think think
how many eggs have you got
not a good idea to put on a tomato is it
come on
count the number of eggs into the box please
I want to know how many you've got Mister_shop_keeper
one
two
how many  that
one two what
oh and an apple
have you only got three eggs
that's not very useful is it
you have_to have more than three
three eggs
an apple a lemon and an onion
right that's your contribution is it
and an aubergine
well the aubergine would be nice with a bit of goat
what did you do with that goat
well I'm not sure
they make some very nice dishes in Greece out_of goat and aubergines
all right then
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
and how much do all these things cost
twenty pounds
you've got_to be joking
I'll give you thirty pence
that's just about right for three eggs
thank_you
now I'm going to go home and bake a cake
do you think a witch'll come to my house if I bake cakes
you think so do you
which one's got what
that one's got a hole in it

do you like beans
hmm
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that's a figment of your imagination thinking that's going to be so
the only thing you're in line for perhaps if you're a good boy is I might let you watch Playdays
well it's it's a roundabout
oh no
it isn't is it
it's the play staff today isn't it
could be about anything
might be nursery rhymes or games
or they might build a little house with three little pigs in it
or three little houses with three little pigs in
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
and what will the wolf do
yes
would you like to be the wolf
I thought you might
little pig little pig

not by the hair on my chinnie chin chin
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
not in your what
shop
oh is your house a shop
