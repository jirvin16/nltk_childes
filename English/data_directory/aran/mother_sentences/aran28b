are you taking that train to bits again
you put that on the front don't you because that's that's er
what do they call them
cattle mover or something
something to do with pushing cows out_of the way isn't it
when you're on the railway line
and there's a cow crossing the railway line
it pushes the cow out_of the way doesn't it
what are you doing
well that's the carriage to the train isn't it
that goes on the back doesn't it
no
that's the front darling isn't it
look
that's the front isn't it because that's where the cattle mover goes there
that's for pushing the cow out_of the way
there's the cow look
oh

well I think it's just the way he's made isn't it
that's the way he's made
his head turns round
oh look
here's the engine and the smoke stack
there we are
the shark is going to have a ride is it
there must be some other bits to the train mustn't there

let's build a great big tower up
oh look
there's a bit more
a bit more to that train isn't it
what are we going to build
are we going to build a farm
right
for Pingu
where's Pingu living at the moment
in the North_Pole still
or South_Pole it is isn't it
right
we'd better have a blue farmhouse then for Pingu
are you coming to help me
Pingu's igloo
is that what it's got_to be
oh Aran
I don't think Pingu has a horse to ride
I think Pingu has a sledge
right
here we are
this is Pingu's sledge
that's one of its runners
isn't it
that can be the door
perhaps we'd better have a blue door
well everything in the South_Pole is blue because it's cold
it's either blue because it's cold or it's white because it's snowy
do you agree
you agree
well that's green
not blue
now don't throw
it's only a way of talking
well it doesn't look like a way of talking to me
come on
you find me some more blue bricks
I think this is all going to be rather difficult because I think this horse is rather tall
don't you
he's too big to ride is he
right
this is Pingu's igloo isn't it
pardon
let's make what
yes
that's monkey monkey
what do you want to make Aran

don't you think it's a bit cold for monkey though by Pingu'sigloo
you don't see many many er monkeys when you're watching Pingu do you
just see seals and penguins

Pingu can go in
don't knock the roof down because it's not very stable
