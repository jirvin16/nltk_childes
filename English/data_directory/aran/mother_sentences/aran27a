Postman_Pat's a lot more pleased isn't he
because he's got some letters

for him
and what's he got_to pay

oh a letter about fixing the fence did you say
oh right
a letter about fixing the fence
well that's jolly good isn't it
have you seen a picture about Ted_Glen fixing the fence
and did he do it well
not really
you wouldn't employ him twice then would you
can Ted_Glen come and fix our fence where you poked a hole in it
how much are you prepared to pay him
Margaret and Mary'll pay help to pay for it because it  half their fence
only you did poke the hole didn't you
and what did you do when you wanted to go and see Margaret and Mary
hmm
to see the doggy
I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about when when you climbed over the fence
and what did you do with Margaret and Mary's pussycats
oh shock horror
what a naughty thing to do
well I think we'll take this train onto its next stop
well I thought it was going to take this to Bella's cafe
Bella's cafe's over there
shall we go and get a picture of Bella
go and get our book about Bella and make it into Bella's cafe
only I don't want you to mix with that naughty Norman_Price
why
what does he do
here we are
here's Bella's cafe
well she will be if she doesn't get this delivery of spaghetti
there we are
there's Bella
what's she cooking
is Trevor cross
why
well Trevor's in the middle of eating a pizza
he doesn't look very cross to me
and what about Nicola and Aran
what are they doing
they're cross
why are they cross
because they want some spaghetti
well they look very happy to me tucking into that ice
oh dear
we seem to have some problems on
oh look
a boulder on the railway
nearly derailed the train didn't it
carefully now
I think this train's going to be late isn't it
well don't stop it until it gets to the right stop
you're just short of the station
that's it
that's it
we've just got there
right
are you going to unload the spaghetti for Bella
hmm
do you need a truck to put it in
oh the train's going without you
do you need a truck to put it in or are you just going to put it straight into Bella's cafe
you need a truck
let's find a little a little truck then should we
what sort of a truck
I think we'd better have this truck
here we are
you're going to have a good few journeys though in that truck aren't you
it's not a very big truck is it
why is everybody so cross today Aran
they want some spaghetti
well they look as though they're managing very well with pizza and ice don't they
do Nicola and Aran like ice
no
not really
and it's
look
it's strawberry ice as_well isn't it
look at all these things Bella's got_to make some some sauce to go with the spaghetti
look
she's got some tomatos hasn't she
and she's got some mushrooms
and some onions
why
has Rosa run away again
where's Rosa run to
where do you think she's gone
why is he very cross
he wants something to eat
but look
Bella's just given him a bag full of sandwiches hasn't she there
oh look
here's Rosa
where's Rosa gone
where's she stuck this time
no Aran
you're being very silly
all right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
it was a silly thing to do wasn't it
no
well nobody can eat spaghetti until it's been cooked
that's what Bella does
Bella cooks the spaghetti
I could do yes but I don't think I'll bother now
I think it's probably got germs on it after being rolled all over the floor by you with your digger and everything
what do you think
oh no
the driver doesn't want want doesn't want any spaghetti
not until it's been cooked
go on
you take that to Rosa's cafe
let's put it in the truck
for Rosa is it
does Rosa eat spaghetti
I thought Rosa liked something quite different
what does Rosa like
what do you think Rosa likes
what would you like if you were a pussycat
what do pussycats eat
what does Poppy like
sardines
what does Jess like
she likes sardines too doesn't she
so
come on
let's bring this truck back for some more spaghetti
are you going to help unload it and put it in the truck
whoops
the train's going to go if you're not careful
better get the freight unloaded quickly
willn't willn't willn't willn't
I don't think anybody wants any spaghetti
or do you think Missis_Dyllis_Price wants some at the store to sell
hmm
shall we take some to Dyllis_Price at the store
yes
she often is very cross isn't she
but then she's got naughty Norman_Price hasn't she
oh sorry
Dyllis Dyllis_Price
yes that's right isn't it
look
that naughty Norman_Price
he's taken a tin out_of that stack and they've all fallen all over the ground haven't they
you wouldn't do anything like that would you
you want to be naughty Norman_Price do you
you think that'd be good fun do you
well naughty Norman_Price often gets into trouble doesn't he
yes he does
he often gets he's got stuck there hasn't he
where's he stuck there
in a hole
and is Fireman_Sam going to get him out
well I wouldn't get him out if I was Fireman_Sam
would you
I'd leave him there
what is it
it's to keep him in there
I think
oh those masks
to go down into that er so_that they can breathe properly
I think they are aren't they
yes
you're right
Fireman_Sam took one down with him for naughty Norman didn't he
oxygen mask sort of thing
right come on
let's deliver this to Dyllis's store
oh there we are
come on
are you delivering some more
how much is this spaghetti Aran
two pounds in money
seems a little expensive to me
I think I can get cheaper than that at Sainsbury's
well you've not given Dyllis much have you
you've taken it all to Bella
what're you going to do about it Mister_deliveryman
oh
so even more freight for the railway
is it going on a long journey
well I think he's taking it to Russia isn't he
they need gritters in Russia and snow snow removers
that's Russia there is it
doesn't look very cold to me
where's all the snow
it'll soon come will it
right okay
come on
get the gritter out
going to sell for a_lot_of money that is isn't it
very expensive vehicle isn't it
is it moving the snow now
is this a demonstration of how well it works
hmm
Bella likes eating snow
how've you come to this conclusion
it's gone cold and there's lots_of snow is there now
no
well what is there then
frost
is Jack_Frost coming for your fingers and toes
isn't he
put what
your toes
I should just leave them on the end of your feet
they'll be all right Aran
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
Mummy'll lend you a pair of slippers
come on
is the train coming back for some more letters then
is it going to be the mail train again now
we're going to have bits of spaghetti all in the carpet aren't we before we're much older
just pass me that little bag please
then I can put these bits in
just these little bits
you can have the big bits
are you playing at being a horse
what's your name horsie
you don't know
oh
you're going to have an accident here
put the keys in properly
where are the keys going
are they going to Postman_Pat
shall we have him waiting at the station for the keys
shall we find your little Postman_Pat and
what's happened here
the railway's coming adrift isn't it
look
here's Postman_Pat waiting in his car with Jess for the keys
the G_P_O keys
is that right
what's Postman_Pat doing now
he's parking
just there
where's he expecting the train to stop
wherever your heavy hand lands on it
oh you didn't press the button properly did you
that's it
right
are those the keys for Postman_Pat
hmm
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
um here he is
go out_of his van
standing beside his van now
he's waiting for the keys
oh thank_you
thank_you so much
there we are
shall we let Jess out for a little run while we're about it
go on Jess
you have a little run round the station carpark
well Jess is having a little run round the station carpark isn't isn't he
say that again Aran
he picked the what
oh right
did he
oh all right
get your car
which car do you want
that's not car is it
what is it
what do you want that for
that's a label
it says this this tool belongs to Aran_Reed
or at least it would do if I wrote on it
workshop address it says
are you playing at being a pirate with that
is that your eye patch
oh how kind
thank_you
come on
you left Postman_Pat in the carpark with Jess
Jess is having a little run round
she's stretching her legs isn't she
it's been a long round and she hasn't got out_of the van on this this round has she
so that's why Postman_Pat's let her out
come on
what are you going to do with Postman_Pat and Jess
are you going to put them back in the van and send them off to the post office with the keys
the keys are most important because there's Missis_Goggins
she's locked inside the post office
well I don't know
somebody must have locked the door to the post office and lost the keys
was it Postman_Pat
a well those might be a spare set of keys that the postmaster general sent
what's that on your
oh it's all right
where's he left the keys
come on
here's Postman_Pat and Jess
both back at the post office
and here are the keys
are they going to unlock the door and let Missis_Goggins out
there we are
they unlocked the door
hello Missis_Goggins
are you there
oh hello Pat
I'm so pleased you've let me out
is that what she's saying
did she like being locked in the post office
come on Mister_silly
do you think it was naughty Norman_Price that locked Missis_Goggins in the post office
should we have sent for Fireman_Sam
I don't think that can run on the railway can it Aran
no
it can't
no
it can't
no
it can't
no
it hasn't hasn't got the right sort of wheels
yes well I think you'll find that if it came down to a battle the train would be a lot stronger than Postman_Pat's van
well shall we put your train away now then
look
that's got different wheels
that's got flat wheels
and this one
look
look at this one
this one's got a wheel with a ridge on it to get on these rails
that's why Postman_Pat doesn't go on the railway line isn't it
hmm
Postman_Pat can go on the carpet can't he
or on the road
come on
there you are
no
you're getting silly now Aran
well he's a very lucky man that he can do that in his post office van isn't he
