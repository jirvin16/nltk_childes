we'll open the barn door
there's one cow in there
oh that one's much better isn't it because that one's the right color

what was this
that was a duck wasn't it
and what's that
and what's in here
and what are these
pussycats aren't they
we're going to start again are we
a
oh don't do that
what's Spot's Daddy driving
a tractor isn't it
shall we make a tractor out_of one of these
hmm
um let me think
shall we have a red and blue tractor
there we are
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there we are
make that our tractor
look
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there we are
there's a tractor
look
Spot's Daddy's driving the tractor isn't he
yes
of course there's a dog in there
we've found it several times
you find it Aran
it's a black and white dog isn't it
oh look
and the tractor's got a trailer as_well hasn't it
look
there's a little boy in the back of a trailer
shall we find the dog and put the dog in the trailer as_well
hmm
come on
can you find that dog Aran
there's the dog
what shall we call the dog
is it Spot
or is it something else
don't put that in your mouth Aran please
shall we call it something else
why
because it might damage your teeth and secondly people don't want to play with things that you've had in your mouth
it might come as a surprise to you but
no
if you're going to put them in your mouth then I'll take them off you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
all right
that's just on your nose isn't it
right
what's this dog called
is it called Rover
hmm
is it
or do you want it to be Spot the dog
oh he's in the trailer with this little boy
shall we call him Rover
right okay
where do you want that to go
well shall we put it in there like that
whoops_a_daisy
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well I don't think you've done much damage to it have you
look
we've got out tractor
where's the big wheel
no
but this one has a big wheel doesn't it
at the back yes
where's the little wheel
and what have we got here
what's this
is that the engine
right
is the tractor going round the farm
with the dog on
what's it going to pick up
hay
is this for the chickens
well who does eat hay then
hmm
is it coming into the barn
all right
well take everything out_of the barn
you take the tractor into the barn
there's lots_of hay in the back is there
right
that's jolly good isn't it
are you going to take some of the hay out for the animals
hmm
who's hopping
is it the dog or is it the little boy
hmm
well do you want me to stand him up properly for you
oh he's he's he's only a little dog really isn't he
shall we stand him up there
that's right isn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well because when the tractors move too quickly it lurches and people do fall over don't they
pardon
what's in the way
that snake
did you move it out_of the way
you couldn't get past the snake so you had to move it out_of the way did you
right
I see
oh the roof of the cab's falling off
you'd better put that back quickly
because it can be dangerous if you've got a tractor without a cab like that you know
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
when it rains
well if it rolls over the man the man who's sitting driving it might get crushed mightn't he if there's nothing to protect him
what is it then
we're pretending it's a what
what do you think it is
well I should imagine one of the other little boys built it
what shall we pretend it is
hmm
what do you think it is
a castle
you think you built it did you
I'm not sure about that Aran
all right
if you want it to be a castle shall we have it as part of a ruined castle on the farm
hmm
if you stand it up you can put the animals to shelter behind it in the rain
oh dear
go on
you stick it back
we'll put the animals to shelter behind it in the rain
well animals don't like to get too cold and wet
they always look for a shelter in the rain
you don't like standing outside in the rain do you
no
I thought not
