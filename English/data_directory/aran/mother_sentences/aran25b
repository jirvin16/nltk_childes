we know that
oh well
I'm going to be the vet visiting all these cows and these horses
I'm going to see what's wrong with them
these two cows haven't been very well
they've had bad coughs
well I think they've been outside and have caught a chill haven't they
it's been very wet and very rainy
and the farmer forgot to put them into the barn at night didn't he
that's the vet
isn't it
it's not the farmer
now these two pigs haven't been very well either
because they've eaten something that's disagreed with them
so they're feeling a bit sick aren't they
come on
and here's the farmer riding along on his horse
he's not a very good farmer is he
if he lets his animals get sick like this
is he Old_McDonald
no
come on
you eat that up quickly now please
and these chickens
he's having a look at these chickens because they haven't been laying any eggs
and this dog has got a poorly foot
he's trodden on some glass and cut his foot
somebody somebody broke a left a broken bottle didn't they
and the poor doggy put his foot his paw on it didn't he
and it hurt him
and it started bleeding didn't it
and this horse has just got its foal hasn't it
so the vet's coming to check that the horse and the foal are all right isn't he
and here's some more of those nonlaying chickens
so what do you think of this farmer
is he not very good
no
come on
swallow that please now
doesn't take you that long to eat a jelly baby
does it
hang on a minute
yes
well we are hanging on a minute
you look like a real waif and stray don't you
I think you're the farmer
you've got bits of straw sticking out_of your hair haven't you
has that farmer got Wellingtons on
are you sure
when we saw the farmer did he have Wellingtons on
oh you can't sit on that horse
you're far too big
you want to be the farmer do you
are you going to be a better farmer than this one
are you going to feed your pigs properly
and put your cows in the barn at night
are you
hmm
not at the moment
right
oh well
is that the pig eating
has he recovered
is he able to eat again now
has he got over his sickness
hmm
oh I thought it was the cows that had a bad cough
what does Mummy give you when you've got a bad cough
medicine yes
do you think the farmer's got any medicine for the cows
all right
put it down please
all right
no
she's not
come on
in in here
we're not going upstairs
well it's too far isn't it

come on
were you with Daddy when he bought it
I don't think so
it was a present wasn't it
you were with Daddy and I when we bought this weren't you
come on
you said you were going to be the farmer
I think I think there are a bit too many squares on there for you just yet aren't there
well no
come on
perhaps we can make our own
we could divide a piece of paper into into half a dozen squares couldn't we
we could paint some snakes and ladders on couldn't we
would you like to do that
you've got_to go down because you're on a snake
mhm
there isn't a bus on it
I don't think there's a bus on there Aran
it's not it's not like the one you saw on Playdays
there was a bus on the one we saw on Playdays wasn't there
hmm
do you remember that
come on
let's play at farmers
we can play with the snakes and ladders afterwards
these animals and bricks will be gone in a moment you know
here's this bad farmer again
the bad farmer
yes
the one that's let all his animals become poorly
is that not the one
is it the red one over there
course he's got a mouth
right
well you find the red one
it's just by your foot Aran
it's just there isn't it
that's red
and this one's blue
no
you're not looking in the right place are you
is that the bad farmer
is he Old_McDonald
or is Old_McDonald the good farmer
excuse you
no
don't don't be any sillier than you can help
what was smashed to bits
come on

come on
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm

whoops
half my roof's fallen off
and again
yes
I'm not very good at this really
there we are
oh I think it's you
it's you that keeps knocking it down isn't it
it's not me at all
let's see if we can make it a big higher
why are you taking all the cows out
what have the cows done
the fish can go in
the horsie can go in
can the horsie stand up properly in there
oh dear
I think my building techniques have gone a bit astray here
what are you sorry for
knocking my roof down
oh well never mind
we can manage can't we
the doggy can go in
well that's a good idea isn't it
he can keep guard can't he
and then if any robbers or burglars come to try and steal the animals he can bark can't he
have you put a fence up to stop people going in and out
hmm
the goat can go in
has the goat got any babys
hmm
is that it then
have you finished
oh
what have you got in there
a goat
a dog
a baby horse
and what's the other one
that's not a goat
that's a goat
oh you've got the bull in there
oh that's a bit dangerous that is isn't it
it's not
it's a goat it's a bull that
a Daddy cow
oh they get a bit cross they do
well they're just like that
they get very cross very quickly of you're not careful
you go into the field where they are and you're not careful and they're in a bad mood oh
they run after you
just like this
with their horns sticking out
and they stick both horns in your bottom
and toss you up in the air like that
right over their back
that's just what they do
if you're lucky they toss you over the gate
like the sound of that do you
I don't think you'd enjoy it really you know
might get hurt mightn't you
oh take that out_of your mouth Aran
we don't put things in mouths
now don't be silly
shall we put something else in the barn
shall we put the pigs in the barn as_well because they've they've eaten something that's not very nice
and they need a bit of a rest don't they
it's a good idea to put the baby horse in wasn't it
because that's only just been born
Aran
take it out_of your mouth please
come on
