shall we see if this will make a roof
will it cover fox
oh no
fox's ear is sticking up too much
shall we cut his legs off
oh dear
do you think he'd like to lie down
hmm
he could have a lie down in his house couldn't he
and then we wouldn't have the problem of the ear would we
just got problem that the roof's too short
poor fox
yes
poor fox
well he's decided to have a lie down hasn't he
so it's not a problem is it
do you think we should build a different house
oh no
you've bulldozed the house with fox and badger inside
that wasn't very nice was it
shall we build another one
you've knocked the house down haven't we
there's one at the farm is there
are you sure
have you seen it
oh you are doing well
you've been driving it have you
oh
in the snow
oh you've been moving the snow
you mean like Postman_Pat did with the tractor
here we are
and you think fox's ear'll go in this house
oh
have_to do something about that ear
tell you what
shall we put another story on it
now don't knock it down until we've built it
there's no point in knocking it down until we've built it is there
is there another brick anywhere
you've eaten one have you
right
well we haven't got a problem with the ear anymore
we've just got a problem really if it's
oh it's just about big enough for fox and badger
just about
if they breathe in there's enough room
shall we have a front door
shall we have a fancy one with pillars at the front
and great big green things
with blue wobbly bits in
where's the other blue wobbly bit
there it is
no
you haven't
you haven't
not really
there we are
now come on
let's have these two bricks on the top
make it look like a roof
oh that's a fancy house isn't it
for fox and badger
it's just the right size as_well
there's no problem with that ear is there
bit of a squeeze inside
oh
didn't fox and badger like it
are you sure Aran
you want to knock it down do you
there's one at the farm is there
I don't think there is you know

well I thought this was the crane
right
I think I can find all I need now can't I

there isn't enough room for big boys like you in that box
and what happens if you break it
nearly a nasty accident that was wasn't it
enough of that

we don't want the box breaking do we
we want the box keeping so_that we can use it to put things in

after all my hard work
isn't it
right
they're tied together now
well what about the hook on the end
you seem to have forgotten about that don't you
it's a tractor with a crane on the back isn't it
well which house are you going to knock down
Mummy's house
it usually is Mummy's house isn't it
Mummy spends ages building these houses up doesn't she
and you knock them down
words fail me Aran
they really do
I think you're going to do yourself more damage than anything else
you sit on the back
you sit on the back like that
honestly
your bottom's too big for that seat
that's the trouble
I think you'd be better without the exhaust wouldn't you
you don't need an exhaust really do you
right
Aran
there isn't enough room for you to sit on the front
you sit on the back
you sit on the back
please help you knock a house down
right well we've got_to build a house up haven't we first
let's get something to build a house up with
well I'm going to build a house but you've got_to let me build it before you knock it down
