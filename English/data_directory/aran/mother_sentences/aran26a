do you want Mummy to do it
yes please
we were having a nice game with this lot
mhm
and how did the crash happen
yes but yes but you know a crash doesn't just happen
somebody has_to go off the road or something like that
or perhaps this man's coming too fast round the bend
and he goes round like that
oh smash into that one
that's a terrible crash isn't it
but we do need to send for the breakdown truck to sort it out don't we
what have you done with the top of crane
you were asking me to put it on a minute ago
well I can't put it on because you've lost it
come on then
I think we'd better send for the fire as_well hadn't we
are you going to ring up and send for them
what do you dial
nine nine nine
emergency
which service please
go on quick
tell them what you want
do you want the fire
but Aran
the fire has_to follow the road system doesn't it
you see
and the arrows are on it to show you you see
everybody has_to pull in like Mummy has_to pull in
neenaw
it's got_to follow the one way system
neenaw
there he is
now what's going to happen
shall we get these search lights up
so we can see what's happening
is it dark or is it light
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I think we'd better send for Bernie_the_breakdown_truck from the service station
he's got_to go round the one way system as_well hasn't he
all the way round here
only he's not in so much of a hurry is he
now there he is
are these cars crushed to bits or are they just a little bit damaged
they're crushed to bits are they
well do you think we need some cutting equipment
to get these er these poor men out_of here
yes well we'll just have_to imagine a cutter
you know like the one in that Fireman_Sam book that Penny has
well we'll have_to pretend that we've got something like that
when you cut all the top off the racing cars and you've got the people out then they can be taken away can't they
well the people are taken away in an ambulance
go on
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
neenaw
that's the ambulance isn't it
so we put the people in the ambulance in the back of there
they'll have_to go to the hospital
where's the hospital
hmm
have we got one
I think we haven't have we
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
look
all this traffic's building up isn't it
all this traffic
there's a great big traffic queue
all round the back of here isn't there
there's a traffic jam
Gumdrop was in the traffic jam
where is Gumdrop
is this Gumdrop
right
and where was Gumdrop in a traffic jam
hmm
oh no
we're not having any more crashes until we've got this one sorted out
no
Gumdrop doesn't crash into anything
Gumdrop doesn't crash things out_of the way
Gumdrop turns off and goes round doesn't he
and takes a detour
shall we have this little man as a policeman waving people round the accident
hmm
so he's pointing to where to go
you see you go round him don't you over there
no
not over there
that's right in the middle of the accident isn't it
come on
you've got_to go round that way there
and everybody's looking to see what's happening
right
come on then
we'll take this one to the service station
see if you can get it there
right
there we are
there we are
Bernie_the_breakdown_truck's taken him
and they're going to put it on there on the ramp
just to see if it's worth repairing
oh_goodness me
it is in a state isn't it
I think the back axle's gone
and here's the breakdown truck coming round again to get
oh that one's gone to the hospital Aran
round there
the hospital's round there
and we'll take this one as_well to the garage
see if we can get it repaired
that one didn't crash
Gumdrop hasn't
Gumdrop never crashes
there you are
that one's waiting now
and the fire now he's used his cutting equipment he  going back to the fire station
he goes back nice and quietly doesn't he
all the way round here and reverse in
and so he can be cleaned again can't he
and have all his equipment checked
it's going back into the service station isn't it
right
what else is going to happen on our road system
shall we have a proper traffic jam
this crane's moving very very slowly isn't it
everybody's got_to queue behind it
or better still
shall we have a bulldozer and a crane
bulldozer goes really slowly doesn't it
and everybody's got_to wait haven't they
and here's Postman_Pat
Postman_Pat's getting rather annoyed
because he wants to get through to the post office quickly doesn't he to pick up the post
is he pushing the crane out_of the way
why's he doing that
oh right
so you've used your bulldozer to push everybody out_of the way so Postman_Pat can get to the post office on time
this road system doesn't make a_lot_of sense
it seems to me to be rather continental
everybody's on the wrong side of the road aren't they
there we are
Postman_Pat's at the post office
getting all the letters to take to people isn't he
right
come on
where's Postman_Pat going to first of all
hmm
has he has he got the letters for the bank
the bank manager
what's the bank manager called
Mister_Moneybags
hmm
there we are
leave the letters
there's all sorts of things there
cheques for the bank
leave those there
go back
we'll go round here
we'll go to the hotel
what sort of letters do you think Postman_Pat's got for the hotel
are you interested in what sort of letters Pat's got for the hotel Aran
or do you just want to play at crashes and bulldozers and things
I thought as much
well come on
you tell me what's happening
they're all crashing all over the place are they
oh dear
oh you always have
ask for something different
all right
right
shall we get some bags for the dust while we're here
then you can load up your dustbin cart
right
we'll get some tissue paper and make it into some bags
you stay here
oh look
here's your crane
your proper crane
where's that going
you put that on your road system
what is it then
here we are
here's a bag of money for Securicor to take to the bank
there you are
here we are
we've got some tissue paper
shall we put all the dustbin sacks out
right
I think the hotel'd have the most wouldn't it
one
how many dustbin sacks should we have at the hotel
two
well two  no use is it
three
come on
are those in the bank or is Securicor going to take them to the bank
hmm
no
the dust don't take them
come on
shall we hide them in the Jordan's lorry
oh we're putting these dustbin sacks out aren't we for the dust first
and then we'll deal with Securicor
how many  we got
four
there you are
five at the hotel
I think
oh is that six at the hotel
we'll have just one at one at the church I think
you want two do you
how many do you think they have at the school
hmm
two
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
the snack bar's here
with the sandwiches
sandwich
right
come on then
we've got a few dustbin bags out
here are the dustbin men
are you going to be the one that lifts all these bags into the dustbin
into the dust cart
right
well remember they go very slowly
what do they do first of all
no
they don't
they collect them don't they
little men go all the way up the path and they collect them into a big pile
so you want them all on the roadside don't you there
all those ones from all those ones from the hotel
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm
is it crunching everything up
oh it seems a bit full
do you think you'll have_to go to the depot and empty it out
and where are you going to have your dustbin depot
where's the dump
hmm
it is
the civil community compound
come on
all out
he's crunched them has he
right well you'd better go round the roads hadn't you and gather some more
look
you've left two at the hotel and that's just for starters
three at the hotel
well get the dustbin cart in the right place
you've got_to get it open haven't you
and how many are you putting in there
he's going to crunch something else is he now
oh I think that's full isn't it
you've got_to get those little pins right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
now you take those to the dump and empty it out and then you can go back to the snack bar
and the school can't you
he's crunched them up has he
well you've got_to go up to the snack bar up there haven't you to get some more
hmm
how many  you got up there
oh Aran
no
you're a bit too sharp with these things aren't you
they always end up in pieces
right
Mummy'll put it back together again
now you've got_to get those pins just like that
just in there so it'll shut properly
there you are
how many have you picked up at the snack bar
two
well you're picking them up from the snack bar
you're taking them to the dump to get rid of them aren't you
why
have you changed
I don't think they'd have a dump near a snack bar darling
there'd be too many flys and too much dirt
you can't have a the dustbin men dumping everything where there's food being prepared can you
because there's all sorts of germs around
he's going to leave them for Postman_Pat is he
well that's jolly decent of him
oh he's moving them from the dump now is he
oh he is a busy man isn't he
crunched them all up has he
where's he taking them to
to the what
where's that
you show me
where is it
down where
now get those pins in properly or else it'll snap off
the back of the dustbin lorry
you don't put so much in that it snaps off
come on
let me just show you again
are you looking
watch
those pins have got_to go in there like that
put that other sack in
see if it'll go in
yes
of course it'll go in
he's crunched them all up has he
well come on then
take them wherever they're going
I'm sure it's not the snack bar
is it the post office then
are you depositing them all behind the post office
mhm well we know that
are you leaving all those bags at the snack bar
well I think you'll have the public health after you
I think this man is a public health officer
and he's coming to see what you're doing
dumping all this rubbish and all these germs at the snack bar
he'll close the snack bar down if you're not careful
oh no no no
we can't have this situation
sandwiches being prepared where there's great piles of rotting dustbin sacks
oh no no no no
I'm sorry
I'll have_to put a closing order on this cafe
no further food to be served here
oh dear Aran
what's everybody going to do
what are they going to do at the garage for their lunch
what are they going to do at the post office for their lunch and the bank
where are they going to get their sandwiches
hmm
what's going to happen
oh well
you're going to crunch the environmental officer are you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm

you've picked the wrong side again
pushing too hard aren't you
oh well
I shall ask this man to deliver it
this one to deliver all the treasure
and here's the security guard
waiting to receive it
is he going to unload it
take it into the bank
oh he's got_to unload it one at a time hasn't he
are you going to take them out and put them in the bank
these great piles of money
how many have you got
is it treasure
hmm
come on
let's put these on all the different floors
one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten
come on
you're going to have a little lie down
why is that
hmm
why do you need a little lie down
are you so tired
picking up all these dustbin sacks on your dustbin round
hmm
or is it because you got up just after six o'clock this morning
come on Aran
come and play
no
we're not being silly are we
Aran
come on
stop being so silly
oh I shall play with these things then
Postman_Pat's here

come on
here's Missis_Jones going to do her shopping
come on
are you coming
come on
Anna wants to talk to you
she doesn't want a silly boy
you can't what
hmm
it's a great big rock is it that you're trying to move
you can't manage it
all right
that will do
you've managed now haven't you
come on
come down and play please
shall we put this away then
if you don't have those barriers up on the edge of your carpark people are going to drive over the edge aren't they
well why are you playing with your petrol pumps
Missis_Jones might want some petrol on her way to go shopping mightn't she
hmm
you get all the money and throw it in the bin
well that's sensible isn't it
why do you want to throw all the money in the bin
who can't have it
which man
all right
that's the bus driver
we can't pretend it's the security guard
I don't know where his bus is
I haven't seen it for a little while
no
willn't willn't willn't
because I don't feel like looking for it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
no
we don't swing that about
Aran
are you going to fill up Missis_Jones's car with petrol
hmm
is it leaded or unleaded
why can't she have any petrol
Mummy has petrol in her car doesn't she
we go to the petrol station together don't we
who can't come out
at the petrol station
what about it
you can get out and have a look at it if you want to
but you just never do do you
because that man fills it up for us doesn't he
so Mummy doesn't have_to get out either
because it's not a self service petrol station is it
come on then
either we play with this or we put it away
you're going to do what
you're going to break the road up are you
well don't you think you need some road vehicles
what about this one to clear it all away
the tipper
here you are
you that one hadn't you
that's a bulldozer
are you Paddy_roadman
hmm
breaking all the road up
is that your pneumatic drill
isn't there a hole in that bit of the road just yet
hmm
don't you think you'd better move it along a bit and have another hole somewhere else
oh no
because you don't want to take too much road up do you
come on
let's put some barriers up and make a diversion
here we are
right
nobody can come down there can they
and we'd better have one there
where does your diversion end
which bit of the road are you taking up
so it's just that bit of the road is it you're taking up
not that bit
you'd better dig that bit up Aran
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
here you are
here's the dump truck to take all the rubble away
what are we going to use as the rubble
you would
come on
yes
come on
you could take yourself couldn't you
you could but you're not going to are you
right well I'm going to get some rubble to put on the side of the road
that was in Gumdrop wasn't it
come on
are you digging the road up
this is our rubble isn't it
come on
let's have it all at the side of the road
great piles and great mounds of it
come on
are you digging that road up or not
well where did you leave it
oh great piles of rubble
well we'd better we'd better let this little man in hadn't we
sweep it all into one little corner
that's a bit better isn't it
there you are
and is this man going to come along and lift it all up and put it in the dumper truck
right go on then
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
because it's not such a it's not such a large crane is it
if you help him he'll manage it
that's it isn't it
and here's
let's reverse the dumper truck in to get it a bit nearer
it is darling
come on
Mummy'll show you how to do it
put it in there
come on
there we are
one in the dump truck
come on
two in the dump truck
well you can put one in there yes
lift it up with the crane
put the rubble in there
that one's like a skip isn't it
hmm
like that man up the road had at the weekend when he was digging his path up
do you remember that
he made a_lot_of noise didn't he
did you make a_lot_of noise when you were digging the road up
oh I bet the people round about weren't pleased
did they complain at the museum the noise on the road
and what did you tell them
you were very sorry for the inconvenience but normal service would be resumed as_soon_as possible
hmm
right
where are we taking all this rubble
where shall we take it to
to the what
what's the taxi
hmm
Mer_mer goes in a taxi
a taxi is a car that comes to the house to take you somewhere
where've you got this idea about taxis
oh you're throwing bread to the ducks now
I thought this was money
I thought this was treasure
well are you sure the ducks are there
I think the ducks are over there by the pond
well there's the pond
so the ducks can't be far away can they
you've thrown it in the wrong direction haven't you
oh well
never mind
perhaps some seagulls  get it or some magpies
what do you think
or some pigeons
are they hungry ducks
are they eating all your bread up
hmm
what did we feed last time we went to Bramhall_Park
we didn't
we fed something else
it was a great big duck wasn't it
which one was it
was it a goose
oh it was
it was a great big hungry goose wasn't it
and the duck
well he was looking for something to eat and the ducks were frightened of it weren't they
well it was so big and greedy
I don't think geese like ice no
well it's just not one of the things they eat
they like bread and grass and things like that
water
right
where are we taking all this rubble to
hmm
