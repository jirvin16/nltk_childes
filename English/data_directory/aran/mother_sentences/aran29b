what are we going to do now
are you going to play with the train
there's the train and the driver
who put him in
I don't know
somebody else
a nice little boy
are you a nice little boy
yes you are aren't you
you're lovely
look
oh look
there must be some people going for a ride on the train
some coal
well the coal might go in the tender on the back but we haven't got a tender to go on the back have we
perhaps we could use that and put some coal in that
hmm
can we use some bricks as the coal
little bricks
do you
I don't know
where are they going
a cow can go on holiday can it
is this one going to take its friend with it
well is one called Daisy
and the other one called Buttercup
that's a goat isn't it
well why
oh you mean a man a man goat
what are we going to call it
Billy
Billie_Goat
Billie_Goat_Gruff
is that what we're calling it
where are they going on their holidays
hmm
you've got_to put him in there
shall we build a shed for the cows to have their holiday in
hmm
how does what make a noise
well the driver pulls the er the little chain doesn't he and the whistle operates to let some steam out
it goes whoo doesn't it
how does what
well you've just done it
you've hooked it up haven't you
hmm
well I wasn't aware you wanted some help
you usually tell me not to bother
you've got it the wrong way round haven't you
that's why you can't hook it up
what's that
what's that that you've just put in there
hmm
well there's no room for the cows if you're going to put all that in
got_to put a roof on have we
right
and the goat can go in
I think we'd better get organized and get a roof on then hadn't we
I think it needs to be a bit higher before we put a roof on
I don't think cows do wag their tails darling
they swish them to get rid of the flys
yes you're quite right
that's a Daddy cow
that's a Mummy cow
I don't think
is that the little cow
yes
that's the little cow isn't it
baby cow
um what do you think it's called
Lynn
like that one we saw in Scotland
it's called Lynn isn't it
pig called Lynn
no
I don't think there was a pig called Lynn was there
the pig was called
one was called Griselda and one was called Samantha
you put your hand where
on the cats
and your hands had germs on them
did they
you had to wash our hands
all right
let's dress dolly up
what were the germs called
those are trousers
well it must have been a little boy or a little girl mustn't it
are you going to put a dress on dolly
you want to give her a bath do you
it's night time
is she going to bed
you've got_to take all her clothes off have you
right
well you take them off
well I don't know
let me let me have a look at it and I'll tell you whether you can take it off
well I don't know
you can only take it off if it can be put back can't you
there you are
there's the ribbon
well where's where's where's dolly having a bath
well what shall we use as a bath
hmm
somebody like Chad_Valley
well the toy manufacturer
the toy manufacturer
Mister_Lego
in Denmark
hmm
well if she's having a bath we could do
you've got_to take her to the toilet first have you
well we haven't actually got a toilet have we
you've got_to carry her
why have you got_to carry her
some exercise
here you are
there's dolly's bath
there's dolly's bath
it's full of water
it's just waiting for her
what did she have in the bath with her
it bit her toe off did it
people don't usually have cows in the bath with them Aran
well they're rather large
well that is exceedingly naughty
you'd better get her out and change the water right away
hadn't you
have you emptied the water out
she's gone down the plug hole
she's rather large to go down the plug hole isn't she
oh you've got dolly back have you
is she all right after her adventure down the plug hole
hmm
oh is the elephant having a bath now
well that's not very nice is it Aran
elephants usually suck the water up with their trunks don't they
suck the plug hole down his trunk
well what a silly elephant
do you think he's going to choke
you've got dolly now have you
oh you haven't put hot water in
you know dolly might hurt her fingers if you put hot water in mightn't she
you've got_to be very very careful about the temperature of the water haven't you
oh she's hurt her feet has she
what are you going to do
are you going to take her to the doctor
why not
isn't she that badly hurt
oh what are you going to do
are you going to bathe her feet and put some er cream on them
well I don't know about that
let me have a look
you've got_to be very kind to dolly haven't you
well we've got_to do it very carefully haven't we because otherwise dolly's hair'll get stuck in it
and then if it pulls it's very painful isn't it
she will
she'll cry
she goes
and all tears come rolling down her face
you can't see them but they do
there you are
yes
I'll put it I'll put it back in a moment when you've finished looking at dolly
where's that elastic band
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I'm still building this cow shed for you
and it went wrong right at in the middle
the roof fell in on the cows
the roof fell in on the cows
because I hadn't built it very well
that's why
now don't be silly
don't be silly Aran
don't be silly
dolly isn't a naughty dolly is she
oh Aran
Aran no
she hasn't
that's not very nice at all
we don't say that
well does dolly play with with er Tigger while she's in the bath
like you do
does she
does she play with Tigger
and with Piglet
and Helen the hippo
does she play with those
hmm
who does
Spot_the_dog plays with Helen_the_hippo
yes he does
that's quite right
moo generally
don't you think dolly's been long enough in that bath
do you think she's nice and clean
she might be getting cold if you leave her in too long
is her face clean
what about her knees
are her knees dirty
what's she been doing today Aran
has she been swimming
has she got chlorine in her hair
not been swimming
you didn't
are we going to go swimming this week
why not
oh
who's going to cut it
oh are you
are you very good at cutting hair
hmm
if she's a good girl while she's having her hair cut are you going to give her a lollipop
hmm
not while you're cutting her hair
but afterwards
because she eats her crusts
you don't eat your crusts so your hair's straight
well she just opens her mouth and pops the crust in and chews it up
then swallows
well just like you do when you've got a chocolate biscuit
oh is dolly getting tired
do you think we'd better dry her off and put her pajamas on ready for bed
she's standing up on the bath
oh she'd better be careful
you don't want her to slip
has she got one of those mats that you've got_to stop her slipping
hmm
poor dolly
oh ask her if she's hurt herself Aran
has she hurt herself
has she banged her leg
has she banged her elbow
oh so she's not hurt herself then
are you sure
she looks a bit upset to me
is it
you cried
last week
it was this morning that
she likes to eat pigs
I think that's a bit unlikely
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh Aran
that's not nice
come on
dry dolly off and put some clothes on her
is she going to bed
going down the plug hole is she
well don't you think you'd better put the plug in so she can't go down the plug hole
you don't want to lose dolly do you
where will she end up if she goes down the plug hole
we'll never get her back then will we
you've got her back have you
you give dolly a good cuddle and a kiss
well she's had a frightening experience hasn't she getting sucked down the plug hole
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that's a nice boy isn't it
what a nice boy
Helen can be the plug can she
well she's big enough isn't she
she'd certainly stop up any hole in the bath
oh be careful Aran
don't be so boisterous
are you being careful with that box
because you told me Daddy put his shoes in that box
when I was going to cut it up for a postbox you wouldn't let me
you said it had to be kept nice for Daddy's shoes
didn't you
what's the matter with dolly
she wants to stand on the bath
well I think you'll have_to hold her Aran
I don't think she can stand up on her own
it's too too rocky
oh poor dolly
give her a nurse
a
poor dolly
poor dolly
she hasn't hurt herself
can you wash dolly's hair
is it dry now
come on then
I'll put dolly's hair back for her
all right then
you dry her hair
just give it a gentle rub now
Mummy only rubs yours gently doesn't she
well let me do it
are you going to let me do it
get her hair out_of her fingers
now don't throw
thank_you
oh poor dolly
there we are
nice and dry isn't it
nice and dry
right
shall we put the elastic band back on it
why not
you want to wash her hair
oh hasn't dolly got pretty curls
aren't they lovely
do you wish you had curls like that
don't you want curls
why not
well you don't have_to be a dolly do you
Noah at the play has curls doesn't he and he's not a dolly
he's a little boy
a big boy
isn't he
what about Heidi
Heidi lives next_to what
Billy
oh yes she does
has she got curls
hmm
no
she's got holes in her kite
did you see her on Saturday when you went with Daddy
yes
she was flying the kite was she
well this is something of a mystery isn't it
I don't know where your kite is
I thought Daddy knew but he says he doesn't
well that can be Pingu's igloo can't it
there you are
have you found I can see Pingu from here
he's underneath your hand
that's a dog isn't it
what's the dog called
it comes with which man
well I don't know what that's about
come on then
this is Pingu's igloo
here you are
I didn't know Pingu had a dog
what's his dog called
Frosty
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh well
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
special fences
where are you putting the special fences
to stop anybody getting in to the igloo
no girls and no what
and not Heidi
don't you like Heidi
oh
that's a surprise
doesn't sound as though you do
I think you I think you're just one short Aran
if you move that one up one then you've got enough haven't you to put that down like that
there's a special fence to stop people getting in to the igloo
oh well that makes it doubly safe doesn't it
stops people getting in to the igloo
stops people getting near the igloo doesn't it
are there any more
oh well I think perhaps you'd better put that one out as_well
oh that's a good idea if you put it there
stops people coming from that side doesn't it
there is another one
here
are you going to put it there
are you going to stop people coming from that side
right
so the igloo's nice and safe now isn't it
hmm
what other one
what other fence
goes where
here
oh
you'd have_to move one of the others
I think there only are four fences aren't there so you'd have_to move one
oh is that a snake outside that's going to frighten people off
what is it then
a worm
I thought it was a snake
or a tiger to frighten people off
that's a good idea isn't it
that's Tigger
he eats the snake up does he
pardon
no darling
stay here darling
come on sweetheart
yes
I know you are but we haven't finished in here have we
Anna's still talking to you
ssh

she's got a lovely smile for you
now wave to her
yes

let's go and finish talking to Anna and then you can go and have a word with Leah
come on
that's Pingu's igloo isn't it
oh
Anna thinks you're a big boy as_well
she doesn't think you're a little boy who cries over nothing
does she
hmm
oh what's the matter
what's the matter
did you like playing with Leah this morning
hmm
what did you play at
no
it's not bedtime
it's only the girls that have come home
it's not the boys
the boys have gone rock climbing at Edale
they're not back yet
and the girls are just having some tea aren't they
just come in
well we're talking to Anna aren't we
Anna's a girl yes
well you've got_to let the girls have you've got_to let the girls have something to eat first haven't you
and then they might be ready to play with you for a little while
oh no
don't climb over the fence
tell you what
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
come on
you come and talk to Anna

I say you must
well
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I don't think we need the lights on
come on
you find Helen_the_hippo
have you shown Anna your new new new pumps
yes they are
there's something inside them is there
I don't think there's anything inside them Aran
no
we've had trouble with your sandals haven't we
they don't seem to fit you very well do they
we went yesterday to get your shoes measured didn't we
hmm
what did that gentleman say
did he say that your shoes fitted you
no
I don't think there is either
there's only one thing that goes in there Aran and that  your foot isn't it
