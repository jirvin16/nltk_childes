that's not Mister_fox
that's Mister_badger isn't it
Mister_fox is over there somewhere
in this great mess you made
when you tipped the contents of that box all over the floor
to no good purpose
who's climbing this tree
hmm
shall we put some more bits on your tree
yes
there's a tree on there isn't there
that's somebody's garden isn't it
come on
are we having a pussycat climbing this tree
do you want your nose blowing
are you sure
there's a handkerchief here if you do
come on
Aran
we're not playing at hiding
come on
Anna wants to talk to you doesn't she
come on
come and show Anna your new bulldozer
and has she seen your dustbin cart
oh you can
you can see you can see the dustbin men through the trees when you wake up can't you
on a Wednesday morning
where are you going
what is it you want
oh you want your great big digger do you
that's for loading sand up is it
shall we build something on this building site now
we were building a fire weren't we a minute ago
then Anna came didn't she
we had this fire
and then we were making a tree weren't we
for the pussycat to get stuck in
so_that we could send out the fire
weren't we
caterpillar tracks they are aren't they
come on
are we having this fire then
with the fire in
come on Aran
am I playing by myself then
looks that way doesn't it
come on
the fire here
here's the tree
now you can have a pussycat stuck up the tree can't you
or you could have your aeroplane crashing
you'd need the fire for that wouldn't you
well that's handy isn't it
you're hiding your snowplow from Anna
I don't think she actually wants to take it Aran
I don't think anybody wants to take it do they
come on
well you come and show me how it works
come and move some of these bricks on the building site
you use the bulldozer blade at the front
and move some of these bricks on the building site
you coming
you want your digger to cut the tree down
you want it to get stuck up a tree
diggers don't usually go up trees do they
yours is up a tree is it
well is this little man going to climb up and
oh all right
well what are we doing with these fire
is is is there a problem
do we need to call the fire out
no
right
is it going neenaw neenaw neenaw
oh
the fire fallen down
come on
what's happening
are you going to extend the ladders
that little man's going to climb up them is he
well extend the ladders then
pull them out
well it's not pulled out properly is it
they're much longer than that aren't they
here we are
go and stick the little man on the end
oh
didn't he climb that tree quickly
what's he doing with the digger
is he going to lift it off
is he Superman
gently lowering it to the ground is he
yes
oh well done
is the digger driver grateful to him
has he said thank_you
oh the digger's got back up
what a naughty digger
it's like that pussycat in Fireman_Sam isn't it
that keeps climbing trees
come on
is the little the little man needs the ladders Aran
he's missed out you've missed out the ladders haven't you
you'd better use those ladders for that little man so he can get up the tree
oh don't tell me that the fire climbing the tree now
he's got_to stand on that to get the digger down has he
right
does that um ladder swivel round
does the platform swivel round
would you like me to hold the fire so it stays in place
while you deal with the little man
all the way down
oh well done
oh the digger's on top of the fire
is the fire going to take the digger away now
neenaw neenaw neenaw
a
he's going to drive it away is he
is the door stuck
oh dear
is this because the digger's had an accident
are you going to send for the fire then again
with its cutting equipment to open the door
he's having a ride is he
but the little man's in the way darling
isn't he
so if you want to turn it round there's no room for the little man is there
but if you leave it like that the little man can just squeeze in can't he under the ladders
and go back to the fire with the fire
oh
has that digger gone up the tree again
what's it moving up there

a poor little birdie
give him a cuddle
tell him you're sorry

mm
bit tough
bit tough but he seems to have gone down doesn't he
yes he has
it's like you at lunch time
just keeps things in his mouth forever
he's just he's just sucking him
isn't he
not chewing him
he's sucking him
Fozzie_bear doesn't look too happy about it does he
straight down the hatch
oh
give Mister_mousie his lunch
he can't have Fozzie_bear
can't he now
could he have a bus driver
are you sure he is are you sure he is a mouse
are you sure he's not a great big crocodile
I don't think he can eat that darling no
no

I think his mouth's not big enough is it
but Fozzie_bear was just the right size
all right
we'll try and eat a tractor
hasn't it
no
it's stuck in his cheek isn't it
think it's a bit too big for him again

he can eat Mister_fox can he
right
oh
I don't think he's going to manage Mister_fox
and Mister_fox certainly doesn't like being eaten by mousie
let's try Mister_badger
oh he's a bit of a mouthful as_well isn't he
what's the roller doing
cutting mousie down
poor mousie
