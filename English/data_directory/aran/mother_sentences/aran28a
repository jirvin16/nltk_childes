oh that makes a change doesn't it
it's what
there's many left are there

mhm
I think this is a very funny hen house Aran
I don't think it's quite
I don't think it's quite what was intended but never mind
we'll make it look as though it was supposed to be like this
oh dear
we want a good one don't we because then when Jack_tractor comes down the hill and crashes into it all all the hen house has got_to go everywhere hasn't it
no
he hasn't got out_of the duck pond yet
have you got your mobile phone in your pocket anyway

you've just knocked the hill over again Aran
there's the hen house there
right
he's going to pull this tractor out_of the mud
heave
oh yes
with a great big plop Jack_tractor came out_of the mud and Benny_the_breakdown_truck was so taken by surprise they knocked over the hen house didn't they
and what did the farmer say
well I don't think he was actually
he was so pleased that the tractor had been pulled out_of the mud he said never mind
I'll soon rebuild the hen house and set about it at once didn't he
come on
shall we rebuild this hen house
oh right
right

we'll take poor old Benny back to Small_Bill's garage
where's his hen hiding
is it hiding there
just behind Benny_the_breakdown_truck's cab
he's gone back to Small_Bill's garage
and Francis_ford_popular's being horrid to Benny isn't he
let's see what he said
he said something really nasty didn't he
that's the wrong book isn't it
do you remember what he said
he said er
www
well he would be covered in mud after he'd pulled the tractor out of the pond wouldn't he
www
oh poor Benny
www
there it is
and what did it do
splat
www
right
the hen house has gone hasn't it
www
come on
shall we have a look at one of the other books
I don't think that was very successful
do you
shall we have a look at this one about Alfie makes a splash
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm
shall we find another sports car
if you want it to be Alfie_Romeo
well you're supposed to be choosing
not me
shall we have this white one here
right
come on
well we don't need all this crashing do we
we need some other vehicles on the road don't we
I don't think we need tractors really
come on
which one did we say was Alfie_Romeo
that one
no
that one's not Alfie_Romeo
I thought it was that one in your hand
hmm
where are we having the canal
Francis hasn't
no
Francis hasn't
that isn't the duck pond anymore
we'll take that out_of the way should we and leave Francis there
right
Alfie makes a splash
let's see what we need
right
we want Benny_the_breakdown_truck on the way top the car spares shop
oh well what's Francis doing
shall we have him in the traffic queue
you don't want him in the traffic queue
on the ramp in the garage
right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
is this Small_Bill's garage
right
there you are
now put Francis on the ramp
there
there's the ramp
oh Aran
a blue
a dead blue
ssh
it's not that funny
no
it isn't
Mummy's got rid of it all now hasn't she
I'll just go and put it in the bin
now you put Francis on the ramp
what's Francis doing on the ramp anyway
is he having his oil changed
he's what
oh is that to get the egg off his wind
oh that's a good idea isn't it
right
there's the canal
we've got_to have a bridge haven't we
I think we'll have the canal going that way and the bridge going that way
come on
are you playing
or are you playing with Francis in the carwash
what are you doing
oh is Francis nice and clean now
do you think he needs to go on the ramp because his brakes are hurting him
hmm
right
you put him on the ramp then
he's got another egg on him has he
where's that one come from
off the green hen
are you sure about this
you've got_to put him a little bit
that's it Aran
go on
that's it
that's it
he'll go through now
oh that's wonderful isn't it
how much did your carwash cost
oh
and how much are you going to charge Francis to put himself through your carwash
all right
don't spoil it Aran
if you do that it will break
and then where will we be
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
no
don't do that please
right
come on
are you Benny_the_breakdown_truck off to get some spares
we've not got_to crash yet have we
here we've got Alfie_Romeo whizzing along
oh and the traffic's going too slow for him and he wants to get past doesn't he
he keeps looking round and he keeps looking round
brumm
and this this man has_to put his brakes on and swerve
and the dust cart's going too slowly
whoo
he weaves in and out
screech
they're at the traffic lights
what's Benny going to tell Alfie
oh no
it doesn't happen like that
he didn't crash at all
he didn't
Benny_the_breakdown_truck said to Alfie_Romeo at the traffic lights you're going too fast
and what did Alfie say
no
he didn't say crash
he said shut up
he said I'm I'm going to take a short cut didn't he
and what did Benny say as Alfie shot off
taking the short cut
hmm
what did Benny say to Alfie
well that's the end of that if you've knocked Benny_the_breakdown_truck off the road isn't it
oh well that's very good isn't it
right
Benny said to Alfie no
not that way didn't he
why did he say no
not that way
what happened
you tell me
splash
he went down into the canal didn't he
he did say I'm sinking
and along came Benny_the_breakdown_truck to save the day didn't he
and he drove all the way up on to the bridge didn't he
whee
and he dangled his hook over the edge
and it just managed to catch it
now if you're not careful this bridge is going to collapse
he just managed to dangle it and get hold of Alfie's bumper and pulled him up
and Alfie was dripping wet and there were all fish hanging off him weren't there
hmm
and did he tow him back to the garage
let's tow him back to the garage
here we are
see if we can get that
that's right isn't it
there we are
are you taking him back to the garage
because his spark plugs have got_to be dried out haven't they
well he's not reached the garage yet has he
oh there
there goes the bridge
oh there we are
here's poor Francis
here's poor Alfie
you'd better put him on the ramp so_that Mike_mechanic can have a look underneath
well he's going up and down like a yoyo isn't he
right
we'll slide Mike underneath so he can see what's happening
and then we'll get him to have a look at the engine and dry the spark plugs off
well that wasn't a very bright idea
you've gone and squashed Mike now haven't you
how's he going to look under the bonnet if you do that
right
there you are
come on
we got this off the ramp
everything seems to be all right under there doesn't it
open the bonnet
dry off the spark plugs
and there's Alfie just ready
I think you'd better put him through the carwash because he  covered in dirty bits of water from the um from the canal
and he's got a fish sticking in him
and he's got some weed on him as_well
come on
put him through the carwash
you've got_to put him further forward
that's right
I think he's a bit too thin actually
never mind
he's a sports car
right
is he nice and dry and clean and fresh now
it's Benny's turn
I thought he was going to say thank_you to Benny for being so kind as to rescue him and saving his life
is he going to
well what an ungrateful sports car
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right
you put him through the carwash then
is he out the other end
that's why Benny had what
Benny's truck was wet
why
he pulled Alfie out_of the river did he
that's why Benny got wet
well Benny didn't go in the river did he
no
he didn't
he just dangled his hook over the edge of the bridge
it's in that book over there
I'll show you
only one person got wet
and that was Alfie
look
here we are
it's that man next isn't it
there isn't a blue anywhere
the blue died
look
there you are
there's Alfie going down towards the canal isn't there isn't he
look
and there he's going in the canal with a great big splash
come on
here's Benny getting Alfie out_of the river
out_of the canal
are you looking
here
look
it's Alfie that's wet through
how could Benny get wet
hmm
oh look
there's Benny pulling Alfie home
look at all the water coming off Alfie
have you charged up Alfie's battery
well don't you think you better had do
because if it's got wet it might not be working properly
he's going in the river again is he
who's going to rescue him this time
do you think Benny wants to
build the bridge up
what about you building the bridge up
oh I thought it'd be me yes
I think you really need a new one
that one's not a very good one is it
mhm
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you see we have got this truck with a ladder on haven't we
that's very useful isn't it for getting pussycats out_of trees
where's that other one
that I pushed out_of the way
oh Mummy's sitting on it isn't she
this is a very good one
this one is for cleaning lamp isn't it
it's a hoist isn't it
oh who's knocked the bridge over
is it Aran
or is it Benny_the_breakdown_truck
well how is Benny going to dangle his hook now to get Alfie back
hmm
what are you doing Aran
come on
are we still playing with this garage
hmm
are we
or are we going out to clean some lamp with that hoist
hmm
why do all these vehicles have_to crash into each_other
hmm
well if you crash into Benny_the_breakdown_truck then there's no no getting rescued is there
because there's nobody to come out is there
come on
Benny's all wet is he
well what are you going to do about it
that's Alfie
right
you're going to have a look at his spark plugs again are you
well don't forget to charge the battery this time will you
no right
okay
have you got your tools
you're going to need a spanner
aren't you
you're borrowing my spanner
right
okay then
you borrow my spanner
on this occasion I'll lend it to you
that's jolly good
you do a very speedy job don't you with a spanner
no
you can't
what happens when you lower the ramp and you've got that fire vehicle under the ramp
gets squashed doesn't it
well you're supposed to be repairing these things
not squashing them
come on
you get that that car out
do you remember that other story about Mike_mechanic
where he dropped all his tools
and Benny_the_breakdown_truck
he couldn't get up he couldn't get his repair jobs done could he because he couldn't find the right tools
and Benny_the_breakdown_truck went out to the scrap yard and he got a great big magnet didn't he
and he swung it round the garage just like that and all Mike'stools attached themselves to the magnet didn't they
so Mike could find what he was looking for
that's what
carefully now with these
what are these
your stars
and what are these
these are planets aren't they
and that's a giant magnet isn't it
well I think it's a bit
oh look
these are all over aren't they
having difficulty
all right
let me help you
come on
we've got_to
where is Benny
is he here
oh look
here he is coming with his
oh look
Benny's stuck to it
right
here we are
Benny Benny's coming back from the er yard with a giant magnet isn't he to try and find all all Mike's tools that have got scattered all over the floor of the garage
do you remember when he tripped over his tool box
and Francis_ford_popular was complaining because Mike hadn't fixed his brakes had he
right
are those all the tools being collected
come on
here's all of them
that's it isn't it
have you got them all
every last one
jolly good
right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
