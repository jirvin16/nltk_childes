what about this
the infamous chuckle
come on
you get this track right and then we can we can build the bridge
well er come on
how are we having the track
are we having it round
right
all right
you set it going
I'll do the track
I don't see what's so funny about it
can't see anything funny about that at all
it went
come on
I don't actually think it's designed for that Aran
come on
this lady's waiting to go on holiday
she's going up to Scotland
yes but she's going on the train
isn't she
well she's going to Edinburgh
we haven't been to Edinburgh have we
well we did go when you were very small
didn't we
oh could you pack this lady's suitcase for her
what do you think she needs to take on holiday with her
right
her knickers and her bag
what sort of a bag
one with all her sponges and soap and things in
and shampoo
does she need that
and her toys
yes
what sort of toys
what sort of toys do you think this lady has
it's a little girl isn't it
do you think she's got some dolls
and
yes
like me
and and do you think she needs a clean dress
a clean frock
and a clean sweater
it might be cold in Scotland
what about a pair of trousers
all this going into the suitcase is it
right
anything else
hair
toothbrush
anything else you can think of
is she taking a packed lunch
she's not going to buy anything on the train then
has she got some money with her
how much
why does she need lots_of money
which driver
the train driver
right
what sort of a bridge are we having
a cat's face
well how does Daddy do these bridges for you
hmm
better than Mummy I'll be bound
right
well are you going to build the platform up
there you are
have this very long one to do the platform
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well because that shows you where it's stopping
you've got_to
put that on top so_that it shows you where the train's stopping
have you got that clock off that little carriage over there
so_that the lady knows what time it is the train's going
what time is it going
what time
twenty o'clock
there's no twenty o'clock
it's either eight o'clock or it's twenty hundred hours
I don't think it's going as late as that
I think it's going at er ten past eleven ten past ten
right
there we are
that's the platform is it
and here's the lady
is she going to stand there
right
let's have a look at this train
oh well here
we've got the driver haven't we
what goes on the front of this train
isn't there another thing like that
no
the clock doesn't go on the front
this is a diesel isn't it
this is a diesel
where's that other one that goes on the front
what have you done with it
have you and Daddy lost it
oh there it is
well the driver's he's just getting ready
he wants to talk to this lady first of all because she wants to make sure of which train's coming next
doesn't she
because you don't just get on any old train that stops do you
you've got_to make sure you're getting on the right one haven't you
that's the right one is it
where's it going
well that's not the right one at all is it
because you've just said that this lady's going to Edinburgh so if that train's going to London
do you think that train'll go through that bridge
not a hope
we're going to have_to go in for engineering works on the line here aren't we
well because Mummy hasn't made the bridge big enough
you're supposed to know how to build this bridge
you and Daddy build the bridge together
look
where's the bottom of the bridge now
oh you've done that have you
right
can we have a couple more for this side
well we need two more of these big ones
have you got two more big ones
well shall we have two little ones then
right
here we are
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm
what do you think
you want that on the top do you
right
do bear in mind that Mummy doesn't build very strong bridges darling
and if you start to press it very hard it will break just like that
do you not press Daddy's bridges as hard or does he build stronger ones
does does does does does does does does does does does does does does
well go on then
oh dear
there are definite problems with this bridge
because it keeps falling to bits
right well
that's a big bridge isn't it
oh we've got_to get the carriages ready now haven't we
what's happened there
oh we've got the track problems haven't we
right
so is this the train for London

what else do you have

he's here
there you are
has he got his glasses on so he can see where he's going
course you can
are you going to put this top on
you're in charge
are you going to examine the tickets
of course it's gone but the tickets are usually examined when you're on the train aren't they
somebody comes round and asks you for the ticket don't they
hmm
if you've got the wrong ticket you're in trouble aren't you
why are you turning it off
is this which station is this that they're stopping at
have they gone up the East coast line
and stopped at Newcastle
what are you giving her
a ticket
a bit late for that
I think she probably booked in advance didn't she
you'll have_to wait until she comes round again
do you remember going to the station to book Mummy's ticket
mhm
and we went to the station to book Daddy's ticket as_well didn't we
when he went to London
well yes
it was a bit a bit crowded in that er carriage wasn't it
oh that lady's getting out is she
where's she getting out at
is she getting out at Newcastle
right okay
so we have stopped at Newcastle
right
she's got out has she
oh
I am glad that lady's got out
there's a lot more room in this carriage now
is that what she's saying
where's this lady going
is she going to make a telephone call to tell somebody to come and pick her up
is this her son waiting for her
that lady's son
oh he's going to meet her is he at Edinburgh
oh well we'd better take him away for the time being shall we
we'll have him meeting her at Edinburgh
did you meet me when I came back off the train
did you
I didn't notice you
you'd gone to bed
and Daddy was waiting here for me
we met Daddy didn't we
well what was that for
well you're wrecking the station aren't you
and naughty boys get into trouble for wrecking the station don't they
are you going to wave to the driver
what does the guard make the train say when you wave to him and it goes out_of the station
he doesn't say you're a naughty boy
he makes it hoot doesn't he
well he obviously thought that you'd like to hear the train hoot didn't he
do you remember
we walked up to the station to see the trains didn't we
the train came in and the doors opened didn't they
and the guard got off
and he waved to you didn't he
and everybody got on and the doors closed
ssh
did the guard blow his whistle
I don't think they do these days
no
I don't think so
and then he got back on didn't he
the train went and it hooted didn't it for you
come on then
calm down
oh what's happened now
have they got_to Edinburgh
engine trouble
well you'd better go and examine that engine then hadn't you
why not
it's crashed has it
well what are you going to do about this crash
you can't just leave the people there
had you better get an ambulance of a fire out
or a relief train
go on
you get a you get a fire something
or a relief train at the very least
you'll have_to get something
you can't just leave people stuck in the middle of nowhere can you
have you got your fire
what're you going to do now you've got it
are you going to race to the scene with your fire
is the train on fire now it's crashed
oh
so you just need some flood lights and some cutting gear do you
are you going to cut a hole in the roof of the carriage to get the lady out
gosh
that fire being clever
it's driven all the way up the tracks
I think it's going the wrong way now
I foresee another disaster in a moment
when the bridge collapses
well we're in trouble then aren't we
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
so come on
what's this fire doing
which is the naughty way
well why is it naughty
he went the wrong way did he
right well is he getting there now
has he brought his cutting gear with him
right well get to work
are you the fireman
well I'm not going to be the fireman
why should I be the fireman
and what are you going to be
are you going to be the sleeper
are you
come on
I want some help
I want somebody to work the ladders
on this other fire that's coming up
there
I think we've got a very clever fireman here
he's got the ladders he's got the extending ladders
and he's got them onto the roof
and he's going to climb on the roof like that
and he's going to cut the roof open
to let the lady get out
he's going to undo it
he's got some cutting gear with him
and he's going to cut a big hole
they're like big scissors
and he's going to cut a big hole in the top of that roof
so_that the lady can climb out
oh
well that was a_lot_of fuss over nothing wasn't it
everybody's safe again now
gone back to the station
what about the other one
what's the other one going to do
back to the garage then
right
okay
shall we build something else to go on the track
what shall we build
a what
what does it look like
oh it's one of your silly words isn't it
I think we'll have a level crossing
what are we being so silly about now
come on
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I'm going to have a level crossing
come on
Aran
calm down
don't be silly
come on
are you going to come and play or do you want to play with something different
what do you want to play with
look
what what did Daddy say about playing nicely
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
come on
come and play please
come on
calm down and come and play
come on
no
you're just being silly boy Aran now
well I'm not surprised he's stuck
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
now come on
are you going to come and play or shall we put this away
do you want to play with something different
yes
he's put the ladders up to the sky
what's he done that for
well firemen don't usually extend their ladders do they
unless there's an accident
are they on a training run
is that what they're doing
training
training
practicing climbing the ladders
oh okay
do you want to play with your train or not
all right
that can be the river
you're going to knock your fire into the river are you
go on then
what are you knocking it into the river for
the what's a bit hungry
the sharks are a bit hungry
right
he's in the river now
what's happening now then
he's been eaten up has he
by the sharks
you're going to knock the sharks away
how are you going to do that
with your breakdown truck
find your breakdown truck then
now if you come round the front properly you wouldn't have these difficulties would you
where is your breakdown truck
it's lost its hook though
it's lost its hook
well I don't know where it is
right
well you'd better come down and get it then hadn't you
got it
where is it then
well you said Gumdrop had got it
where's Gumdrop
I think it's probably dropped off somewhere
do you think I've hoovered it up
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
it's lost its hook
is it in here
I don't think it is you know
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
perhaps Daddy knows where it is
hmm
it's not there now is it
I don't know
if I knew that I wouldn't be looking for it would I
no
perhaps it'll turn up
come on
you can have
oh there it is
come on
I've found it
right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I think it needs a pair of pliers or something onto it
there we are
all present and correct
what are you going to do
why did you need it
are you going to rescue that fire
you were going to use your breakdown truck to deal with the sharks weren't you
well you don't have_to
it was your idea
has he
what's going to happen on the bank
is all the water going to come off the fire
do you think he has a fish stuck in his ladder
is it
that was a failure wasn't it
the breakdown truck pulled it out and it fell back in again didn't it
what's happening now
again
so there's not much point in him lifting it out is there if he's just going to drop it back in again
wouldn't it be better to take it back to the garage so the engine can be dried out
it would be would it
well are you going to do it then
do you want me to put that hook in the right place
