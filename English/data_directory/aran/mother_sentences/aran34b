well because somebody never wants to play with it do they
well if the cap fits
now we don't do that
right
we can play at Master_Tubby then if you want
I'll tell you what
Master_Tubby is running away from home isn't he
he's stowed away on this train
yes
I know I've put it the wrong way
thank_you for telling me
well you'd better find him hadn't you
well where's the bath
well bring it over here
let me have a look
I can't see him
why can't I see him
well why are you doing that
and does the soap hurt him
that's a very big bar of soap Aran
are you sure it's a bar of soap
oh now don't throw it about
don't you think you'd better use one of these smaller ones as a bar of soap
give Master_Tubby a nice wash
I thought you said he was running away from home though
you haven't finished washing him
what are you doing in there
oh dear
is it
I've got the runaway train here
with a hippo on it
is Master_Tubby going to er join this runaway train
he's not
why not
you're still washing him are you
he must have been very dirty if you've got_to wash him for that length of time
oh what a surprise
you'd better take him back to the shop and get them remeasured hadn't you
hello young man
what's the matter with these shoes
well we'd better measure them then hadn't we
right
I'll get the measure thing out
now what shall we use as the measure thing
here we are
we'll slide one of these on his feet
oh yes
he needs two hole shoes doesn't he
at least two hole shoes
and these are only one and a half hole shoes aren't they
well goodness me
are they hurting him
has he got blisters on his toes
well I think we'd better get him some boxes
let's get some boxes with some new shoes in and we'll see whether they fit then
what color shoes do you think he'd like
green shoes
I'm not sure whether we can supply green shoes
wouldn't he like blue shoes
doesn't he
oh dear
well we'll have_to see if we can find him some green shoes then
right okay
we've fitted some more shoes on him
are those any better Master_Tubby
no
well they should be because they fit you
are they wide enough
are they long enough
oh dear
well let me measure your feet again
I'm quite sure they are
well whose are these great plates of meat
hmm
oh you're Master_Tubby
oh_goodness me
well we know what size your feet are don't we
yours are ten hole feet
never mind two hole feet
I need a double measurer for your feet
goodness me Aran
oh yes
you're at least a ten holer
particularly when that toe's pressed down
well Master_Tubby
what color shoes would you like
are you sure you'd like green shoes
would you like them with laces or would you like them with buckles
like those little boots you had last winter
did you like those little boots
did they hurt you
where did they hurt you
where
show me exactly
point with your finger
that one
that big toe
weren't they long enough
well it's costing me an awful lot of money this is all these new shoes
every time you get a pair of shoes on your feet you say they don't fit you
what about those Wellingtons
do they fit you
where do they hurt you
in the body of the shoe
are they all right on your legs
a little boy
well I don't know who he is
it could be you yes
have we finished measuring feet then and getting new shoes
hmm
get the what
it's over here isn't it
what are we going to build
a barn
what color are we going to have
what color are barns
they're usually red barns aren't they with yellow roofs
shall we have a red barn
well that's blue
now if you do four sides like that how's anybody going to get in
well come on
you know how to put a roof on
Daddy's showed you how to put a roof on
last time you played with him
you're always putting roofs on things and building things aren't you
those are the steps up
well I'm not sure that farmers usually have steps up to the barn
because Aran if you have steps up to the barn how's the tractor going to drive in
right okay
I don't think that's very sensible though
do you
hmm
I don't believe that for one minute
you're very good at saying people have told you to do things aren't you
I reckon that was a porkie
is it
no
well course not
course not
my son wouldn't tell a porkie would he
no
you wouldn't tell a story would you
this seems to me to be a very funny barn
well there seem to be more things in it than out
come on
we need some more of these big bricks don't we to make a roof
have you got any more big bricks
oh there's a white one
well we haven't got much a roof really today have we
because it's broken now
oh dear
it's falling to pieces isn't it
perhaps if we did it that way instead
maybe a little bit
oh dear
all falling to bits now isn't it
like china clay
what's like china clay
why
does china clay break easily
is it china clay that Thomas_the_Tank_Engine carries
oh I thought so
to the harbor
and his trucks
do his trucks behave themselves
do they
that's not very nice is it
poor Thomas
does he get bruises on the back of his er fenders
oh dear
poor Thomas
what are we doing now
you're making a garage so the trucks don't get him
oh put that back
Drybones
Drybone's train
so what is this
is it a barn or is it an engine shed
right
where's the engine going
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
come on
put the engine in
oh nearly nearly nearly
it's still there
yes
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
we'll put that on
now what a smashing engine shed
put those round the side
you can build it up a bit more
that's to stop baddies is it
well what do you think the baddies are going to do to the train
steal it
goodness me
don't you think somebody would notice if they tried to steal a train
he's what
what's very old
is it
very rusty
are you going to clean it up
it belonged to me a very long time ago did it
oh
how long ago
when I was a little girl
are you sure
are you sure it wasn't Daddy's and not mine
oh well I don't remember it
at one time it used to be mine did it
well I the only train there was a Grandma's was Uncle_John's
no
Uncle_John took it with him when he got married
because he finds it impossible to be separated from his toys
yes
Nicola's got some toys
some of Martin's toys were Uncle_John's at one time
well Uncle_John gave them to Martin didn't he
whoops
make the back safe
he's what
they can get into it there can they
they can't
all right
goodness me
haven't we got a smashing engine shed here
no
I don't think Drybones would be able to steal an engine would he
no
he can't
yes
we put those there so he can't steal it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
protecting his engine
can I
right
and what's your name
you're the guard
oh good morning Mister_guard
look at this engine shed
isn't it a fine engine shed
my engine's right inside and it's very safe and it's got all these barriers round to stop robbers getting in to steal it
has it got a window
where
oh yes
it has hasn't it
do you think that window was a good idea
somebody might climb in through that window
right
so they can't climb in
oh dear
we've got a problem with our building here
it's coming a bit loose there
still
I've repaired it now so it's all right
oh
and what's this person down here doing
the what man
the chairman
what does he do
he gives them chairs
does he take the tickets
oh well really he's the ticket collector then isn't he
you're going to clean all the rust off it are you
you cleaned it off
and is it all bright and shiny
what's very big
the engine shed
is it a steam train
a very old one
is that bit of the shed falling to pieces
looks a bit wobbly doesn't it
and if you wobble it something's bound to fall down isn't it
oh dear
that bit's fallen off hasn't it
that bit
where are you going to put it now so it's safe
well that bit's fallen down now hasn't it
shall we repair it again
what a disaster with the engine shed
you're going to be the robber
who's stealing the steam train
are you
goodness me
oh what a naughty man
oh well it's no use stealing a steam train if you're going to break it is it
come on
you'd better get in the back and start stoking up hadn't you
get the fire going so you can steal it
where are the tracks
well then it's very difficult to steal isn't it
now don't be silly about it Mister_robber
I shall send for P_C_Arthur_Selby
evening all
what's going on here
who's got a bit of a cough
engine sheds don't usually have coughs you know
it's people who have coughs
shall we start again
I would say it's more than broken
I'd say it was demolished
are you a demolition gang
you're a robber are you stealing trains
what are you then
come on
what are we going to build now
I can be the robber can I
oh right well
come on
I've got my friend Fred to help me
here you are Fred
you get in there
oh please don't send me to prison
oh no
please don't
I didn't mean it
it was an accident
I didn't do it on purpose
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh
please don't P_C_Selby
we used to go to school together didn't we
you can't send me to prison
can you
come on
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I'll help you to build up the engine shed again
right
you take my driver out
I'm sure it has got a good engine in
really I am
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
come on
if you don't send me to prison I'll rebuild this engine shed right away for you
I'll make a really good job of it
well I was going to steal it you see wasn't I
well I fancied having a train in my back garden
why not
well I thought you wanted me to do a good job and rebuild this so I wouldn't go to prison
and I've done all that rebuilding and you're just going to knock it down again
hmm
well what do you want me to do then
well I thought you said I was the robber
oh_goodness me
well you'd better run after him hadn't you
I've got_to look for the handcuffs have I

the European Court of human rights
for mistreating me while I'm imprisoned
under the Geneva convention I'm entitled to certain privileges
this is prison is it
oh dear

how long have I got_to stay here for

I've not got_to share this prison with those naughty goblins have I
oh dear

I think I'm going to make a bid for freedom
I'm going to try and escape

I think I can dig a hole under the walls
some what near the wall
oh
I'm going to get Daddy to bake me a cake with a key in it
then I can let myself out
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't

thank_you very much for getting me out_of prison with your pliers
that's very decent of you
are you putting those in your tool
why are you banging it
does it need a hole drilling in it
oh I think that's enough knocking and banging with those handcuffs Aran
I'm sure you must have repaired them by now
did you have a_lot_of knocking and banging to do when you were repairing your your engine
did you do a_lot_of rubbing down and painting
a_lot_of polishing
is that why that train looks so sparkling now
how many hours did it take you
oh is that all
that was very quick
what are you doing now
I think your handcuffs are going to end up broken Aran
let alone anything else
well I think you're hitting them a bit too hard
well is it necessary to hit them at all
which bit's broken
do you do anything else apart from repairing metal Mister_Farrier
don't you
