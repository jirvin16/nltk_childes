it doesn't stick very well
doesn't stick very well does it
no
well I thought we were going to play with fuzzy felt and we've got this book as_well
and it's got a story in about all these people hasn't it
and you know that you like Postman_Pat
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
now we've had our television repaired we can watch it can't we
we can work it
that gentleman came last night didn't he
mhm
come on
all right
come on
come on
let's find Postman_Pat
look
there he is
there's Postman_Pat
yes
we watched the television upstairs didn't we
there's Postman_Pat
are you listening
it did work
what a_lot_of cards and letters said Pat
that's because it's Mother's day on Sunday said Missis_Goggins
now where's Missis_Goggins Aran
can you find me Missis_Goggins
where's Missis_Goggins
look
there she is
yes but can you find her
Missis_Goggins
what about some letters and parcels
can you find those
yes
that's right
there's the counter isn't it
is that Missis_Goggins
we'll put Missis_Goggins behind the counter should we
oh I do
look
there she is in the in the
isn't she
well if we put her beside the counter like that then we've got some room for some letters and parcels haven't we
come on
where are the letters and parcels
where are they all
come on
she brought herself
come on
come on
there's Postman_Pat
where's the letters and parcels
come on
stop being silly and concentrate
do you not want to play this game
right then
find me letters and parcels
right well I'll find the letters and parcels
we'll put the parcels and that big parcel on the floor
because it's rather a large one isn't it
here's a little parcel
and we'll give Postman_Pat some letters there
and there's his sack
isn't it
come on
are you going to come and listen to this story and play with this fuzzy felt
well I thought it might be nice to read the book at the same time as playing with the fuzzy felt
because when we played with the fuzzy felt before it didn't really work did it
because we didn't well we didn't really make up a story about the people did we
so I thought if we had a nice story
come on
you come and join Mummy
stop wrecking my chair as_well
come on
because I want you to
because it would be nice
we're not playing at Pingu now
we're playing at Postman_Pat
come on
here's a picture of Jess
oh dear Aran
I think Jess has got lost
can you find Jess
of course you can
can you see Jess anywhere here
well you've not looked very hard
I can see Jess now
there she is
right
what a_lot_of cards and letters said Pat
that's because it's Mother's day on Sunday said Missis_Goggins
oh said Pat
I'd forgotten
I'd better get a card for my old Mother
and a nice present said Missis_Goggins
I wonder what she'd like
come on
Pat was on his way
let's find his van
what color is it
it's red isn't it
and here's Jess to go in the van with Postman_Pat
and he was on the way to Greevesdale farm to see Missis_Pottage
we haven't got a Missis_Pottage have we
oh dear
oh never mind
let's forget Missis_Pottage
oh dear
this isn't going to work very well because we haven't got Missis_Pottage
and we haven't got a Doctor_Gilbertson either
so we'll go on to Ted_Glen
right
are you ready Aran
Ted_Glen
look
there he is
there's Ted_Glen
he's going to fix things isn't he
and what's he fixing
to give to his Mother on Mother's day
hmm
what is it
um I don't know
I don't know who it is
I don't know who it is
is it one it's not one of the Thompson_twins is it
are they the Thompson_twins
look
there are the twins
or are they Missis_Pottage's twins
I don't know Postman_Pat well enough
do you
look
here are Ted_Glen's sheep
and they're in the way aren't they
they're in the way of Postman_Pat's van
so how's he going to get round to all the farms and things
hmm
oh Aran
don't do that
you're going to spoil them
do you not want to play with this
shall we play with your train instead
all right
we'll play with your trains
right
we'll have another go with those another time
well exactly yes
why
that's a good question
we'll have_to get you some like Martin had when he was a little boy
you know like there is at Grandma's
you can make up pictures of your own
that's not very successful the Postman_Pat is it
well it might be in other hands but not in yours
come on
you put the track out
well what's the train going to run on
if there's no track
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
come on
you put those pieces of track on
whoops
I think you and Daddy have mixed up all these pieces haven't you
are you sure you want it like that
or do you want a circle
a circle
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
leave that one I think
right
well you get the carriages then
are we going to build the bridge
come on
you and Daddy built some jolly good bridges didn't you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I've told you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
come on
you show me how you and Daddy made that bridge
what did you use
right
you used bricks
and what did you do with them
Daddy didn't let you didn't let you borrow his bricks
why not
because he was busy was he
you didn't let him play with them
oh dear
you're much better at bridge building than I am
I don't think I can do it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
because that's not going to make a bridge is it
you want to build what
a church
whoops
there we are
there's a bridge for you
it's not as good as the one you and Daddy did though is it
come on Aran
you're supposed to be playing this
what are we putting in these carriages
there's a little girl in this carriage
is she going to stay in there
right well we'll take her out
shall we have her waiting here for the train
we've taken the wrong things out_of here
what are you doing to that lady
that's a lady
you know that's a lady
oh well it might be a girl if you want
a young lady or a girl
go on then
yes
there we are
that's the right one isn't it
shows that she's waiting for the train doesn't it
is that the telephone box on the station
you don't think so
why not
look
here's that lady's suitcase
is she going to have it in her hand
where's she going on her holidays anyway
why not
she can only go on the beach
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well isn't the beach going on holiday
oh
right well we'll have_to remember that
going to the beach is not going on holiday
right
are we putting this carriage on
whoops
lady's is her suitcase going in there
what's inside her suitcase
why not
why not
why aren't I allowed to know what's in her suitcase
hmm
oh
it's knocked it over
because it was in the way of the carriage wasn't it
so the carriage just kept going
where's this train going to
where
is it going to Scotland
Aran
is it
are you planing a derailment
well I don't think it'll work like that
it didn't go the wrong way at all
oh dear
one of the wheels is off the track isn't it
was that what you wanted
oh don't
Aran
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
what do you want to do
hmm
who's gone on the floor
the train
whoops
my bridge oh my bridge has fallen down
is it London bridge
why is it London bridge
what are you doing to the train
are you trying to get your fingers run over
well I'm going to build another bridge
why
because I think a train should go under a bridge
it usually gives a great big whistle before it goes under the bridge
it's going isn't it
we could have a level crossing like there is in that Gumdrop book couldn't we
a crossing
there we are
oh
poor train
you've derailed it now haven't you
shall we bring this freight train
shall we
I don't know whether you can hook it up to that one
I don't think so
you can't hook it up to that one I'm sure
look
here's a freight train
coming along
what's it bringing
hmm
what's in these round ones
are these drums
what are they full of
where's the freight train going
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
because it will crash into it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
are you going to tell Anna about that train that you went on at the fair
what else did you go on
you want to look in the suitcase
see if there's anything in it
right
well let me do it for you if you can't do it
it's very simple really
it's just that your fingers aren't quite long enough
there we are
I'm afraid I'm afraid she hasn't got anything in her suitcase
what do you think she should have had to go on holiday
do you think she should have put a bucket and spade in there
what else
a swimsuit
what about a towel for when she gets dressed afterwards
and some Cheese_ets
anything else
what about a drink of orange juice
that'd be nice wouldn't it
is that what you have when you go swimming
hmm
you did get your trousers wet didn't you
what's going on now
are you going to put that suitcase back on the train
only you'll have the station master out_of that train in a minute to find out what's happening
hmm
that's him
he's going to get out any minute now and he's going to say my goodness me
what's going on with this train
why has it stopped like this in_between stations
because here's the station
the train shouldn't stop outside the station should it
has it stopped because that bridge is dangerous
how is it dangerous
is it going to fall down
no
you're going to knock it down are you
oh dear
oh well that's all right Aran because the track's quite clear
now we've had the demolition man in the train can go in can't it
because the track's quite clear
nothing on the track is there
because the demolition man
yourself
has knocked it all over
and there's none of it left on the track
build it up again
what
so you can knock it down
I don't think that's a very good idea
which little boy
yes well
yes he has
it's a rather nice train that isn't it
is it like yours
well it is like yours but if you have a look he's done things differently hasn't he
hmm
he hasn't got his train like yours
we've lost the stop sign as_well
you and Daddy have mixed it all up haven't you
you've got bones and no stop sign
well that's what I'd like to know
looks as though it's gone forever if you ask me
unless that's it
no
I can't find any stop sign at all
only phone and train
where
that's not the stop sign
the stop sign says stop
just like this
oh yes
that's it
there you are
that's the right one
stop
as this train's in danger shall we take that down like that
and we'll put a big stop sign up here right in the middle of the track so_that the train can't get past
see
dangerous
close the track to the train
closed the track haven't we
stop it says
the station master has_to stop not doesn't he
because it says stop and the station master daren't go on because it might be dangerous mightn't it
hmm
no
I'm not surprised
oh dear me
well
that wasn't very good was it
well I don't think I'm not sure that stop sign'll go on properly
I think it'll just push it out_of the way
just like that
you have_to be a bit have a better stop
there you are
try that
no
that wasn't big enough either was it
are you going to put your train on there
well get it get it on the rails properly
Aran
you either stop it
don't
or not
you don't hold it
what are you doing now
well I don't know that it will darling
you can try if you want
let's just try this bit like that
let's move that up a bit
there we are
shall we try
oh I think it's a bit too heavy for it to pull
it's struggling isn't it
no
I think we'd better not because we might spoil it mightn't we
we might spoil it
well I know
but it is it is I think it's too heavy isn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm
well I tell you what
we could unload this freight and put it on the train couldn't we
shall we do that
hmm
shall we take the passengers out
and take the luggage out
we've unloaded it haven't we
now
right
are you going to put all the freight in there
what are these
hmm
great barrels of chemicals
if you leave it open the top open like that we can get more in can't we
what's that
is that a plank of planks of wood
great planks of wood
and what's that
I thought it might be some hay or something like that
well let's try one of these little square ones
they might go in instead
put the little ones in
come on
let's put them in
oh Aran
you can't put the top down because if you put the top down there isn't enough room for all the things you've put in
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right okay
is that enough enough freight
where's it going
isn't it going to the chemical factory
the lady's going in too
well I don't think she'll be too pleased about that will she
it's hardly a holiday to go in with a_lot_of barrels and things
mhm
I think the batterys are running out aren't they actually
sounds as though it's struggling a bit
er Aran
if you do that the battery will not go at all
the battery will run out completely and the train will not go at all
I think all this is a bit heavy don't you for the train
shall we take some of it off
oh dear
looks as though the batterys might have given up altogether
let's take a bit of this off
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
is it going uphill
well I think really you need to stop it don't you when you're readjusting the er load
where's the train for this one
hmm
shall we build a marshalling yard to unload all the er
all the freight we've bought
all the great big drums of chemicals and things
should we
right
here we are
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right
come on then
well you don't need to take the train off the rails do you
what happens is that you just
no
you leave it all on the rails Aran
and what happens is things like great big diggers and forklift trucks come along
and they lift these things out like that don't they
and then they store them
well I don't know where your digger is
let's go and find that little crane next and see if that'll lift these things off
I think that's perhaps the right size
there you are
you can measure the track with that can't you
Aunty_Kate gave it to you didn't she
right
come on
let's get these unloaded
here comes the arm of the
oh I don't think it's quite big enough is it
we'll just have_to pretend it is
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh come on
the great big one
right okay
you let your crane get them out
right
come on then
that's your crane isn't it
it turns round doesn't it
come on
let's get it out
well there's the stuff in there
and there's the crane in your hand
what more do you want
that's the crane isn't it
mhm
come on
which crane
well I think we only actually have one crane don't we with a bucket like that
well which one do you want
which one
well you can have that yellow one from outside if you want
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I'll get it for you
