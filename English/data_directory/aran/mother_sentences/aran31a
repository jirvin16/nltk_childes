well you do your work but you do it quietly
we don't want disturbing
I don't think Anna wants to play with you Aran
I think you're too late now
well you've been very silly so I don't think anybody wants to play with you
what are you proposing to do with your bricks
exactly
what are you going to make
hmm
you know what your trouble is don't you little boy
you could do with a sleep
yes
that's what happens when you get up at half past five in the morning isn't it
you're making a hen house are you
have you got any hens to put in it
just pretend hens
right well you pretend with your hens
I'm going to do a Pingu picture
what are your hens called
yes
what are the others
hmm
is one a brown one
do they lay eggs
sometimes
not always
what do you feed them on
corn
do they enjoy it
are you sure
they keep coming back for more
do they ever peck you
oh they're very good hens aren't they
what do they do when they're naughty
where do they peck you
on your fingers
and your thumb
where's your thumb
let me have a look
is it
that's not a thumb
that's a little finger
that's a thumb
Tommy_thumb isn't it
where are you
here I am
here I am
how do you do
which one's this one
hmm
is that Peter_pointer
the hen house has fallen down has it
well you  better build it up again
why not
have the hens got flattened
oh well there's no point in having a hen house then is there
if all your hens have got flattened
oh what's happened to them then
they what
they're still in the hen house
well if they're still in the hen house why haven't they got flattened
that's the hen house is it
how many hens have you got in there
I didn't say what color
I said how many
six have you got did you say
how many eggs do they produce
hmm
two dozen
do you sell them to that man on the market
oh
you eat them do you
what do you do with them then
you wash your eggs
and what do you do with them then
you bash them on the side of the basin do you
you bash them on the dog
we haven't got a dog
oh we don't use spanners on eggs at all
right
well I'll build a new hen house then if you're not going to
I can can I
you're going to let me
I'm going to have a super hen house
I'm going to have lots_of perches in it for the hens
for them to stand on
I'm not sure I want any help Aran
I think I could manage without help
oh it's all right
no
like what
oh this is a super hen house
lots_of roosts for the hens
and lots_of little chicks as_well
I feed mine on corn
what do you feed yours on
oh
do you buy it from Bowler's
oh I get mine from Bowler's
I get these in bulk bulk from Bowler's
great big sacks of it
all for my hens
do you feed them on grit as_well
they do
they always eat the grit because it makes a nice shell the egg shells nice and strong
it doesn't make them dirty
why does it make them dirty
my hen house is the best hen house there's ever been
yes
we don't seem to have all the bricks anymore do we
we seem to have lost some
we've lost one of these round blue ones
have you seen it
no
I haven't either
oh there it is there
you were sitting on it
well I think that's the best hen house anybody has ever seen
don't you
is Jack_tractor going to knock it down
is Benny_the_breakdown_truck going to knock it down
is Mummy going to knock it down
how do you know
I might just decide that I don't like the look of your hen house
well I might
I might decide it's not grand enough for my hens
we  better build a new one
what are you taking all the bricks off for
well we haven't decided yet whether this is the best hen house or not have we
oh you've decided it's not
did you ask the hens
well you'd better start building again hadn't you
right
what color's your hen house
well what color are they
oh you've not got very far Aran
it's all fallen over already
going to make another one are you
this is going to be rather a long thin hen house isn't it
where are the hens going to sit
just on that big one
do they know this
have you told them
oh
I think they've forgotten
anyway you're building on top of that green one so how can they stand on it
well that wasn't a very good hen house was it
I think I'll build a hen house of my own
no
don't bother
I can do without your help
in fact I think it might be easier if you don't help me
don't think much of your hen house boy
now go and get that brick please and stop being silly
all right
all right
do you not want me to play with them
right
willn't willn't willn't willn't
right okay
they're your bricks aren't they
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
no
I'm not going to cry
I don't care enough to cry
no
no
no
I'm not crying over a silly little boy
shall I tell you something
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
mhm
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I think I'll go out for a ride in my car
why not
well you're not being nice to poor Anna
you're being silly
no
we don't want you to hide Aran
that's the whole point
well as we can see ninety percent of you it's not really very good at hiding
come on
ask Anna who who's the silliest boy that she has_to come and see
I'm not a boy
no
you're the naughty boy
I shalln't take you out with me again
I shall go out by myself
in fact I think I'll ask Daddy to take me
why not
we'll leave you with nanny
you can stay with nanny for a while
well then stop being silly
all right
it's your hen house
you build it
why do you particularly want a hen house
wouldn't it be better to build a stable for the horse
had you thought about that
well go on then
you build a stable for the horse
well I think I think we can safely assume that we've knocked the hen house down haven't we
well why did you do it then
because you can't help being silly can you
oh look
this is a jolly good hen house isn't it
they all sleep in there
can you see
why not
all right
we'll fill the hole up
what are you trying to do
trying to what
you're trying to make me dead
have I annoyed you so much
and what are you going to do when Mummy's not here anymore then
who's going to look after you
well Daddy's got_to go out to work
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
he's got_to go to work
you can manage
well that was just very very silly wasn't it
no
I've no sympathy with you Aran
no sympathy whatsoever
come on
come on
come on
let's do some more building
Mummy's building up a great big tower here
and we'll see how many bricks I can put here
I've put one red one
look
it's a very grand hen house
another red one
all right then
knock it off
so what happens
exactly
oh right
okay
so what are you going to do then
we're just going to leave it there are we
right
shall we play with something else
are you so fond of your hen house
well why are you bothering to kiss it then
oh dear
what a catastrophe
has your hen house fallen over
oh dear
never mind
you can build another one Aran
right
well let's play
shall we put the bricks away and play with something else
well put it back together again
shall I show you how it was done
you're going to sleep are you
I think that might be a jolly good idea
night_night Aran
it's all right
I'll build the hen house
one yellow brick
one green one
one blue one
oh a great big red brick
a skyscraper hen house
well we've already been through this
right
are you ready now
well you're supposed to cry now because you've just knocked your hen house over again
that's what you did last time
no
why should I
why
so you can knock it over again
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right
a green brick
a yellow brick
one green brick
one great big red brick
oh there goes the hen house
I think I'll make something different this time
there we are
one yellow brick
one green brick
another green brick
are you going to sleep
oh dear
the end of the world's come hasn't it
is this a tower
well it looks like a tower to me
that's a funny noise isn't it

are you going to give me a kiss
right
night_night
