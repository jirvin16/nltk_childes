mending
the
tellie
I
do
not
think
it
is
broken
yeah
right
right
you
might
have_to
do
this
that
is
probably
all
the
television
repair
does
mhm
www
that
is
what
it
is
for
is
it
mended
yet
what
is
the
matter
with
it
it
is
lost
it
is
leads
little
hole
oh
you
ram
them
in
and
you
cannot
get
them
out
again
oh
it
will
sound
good
on
the
tape
should
that
do
the
trick
what
happened
to
the
end
of
your
screwdriver
you
seem
to
have
lost
it
bet
it
is
gone
down
the
back
of
the
tellie
yeah
I
know
that
should
do
but
there
is
another
one
somewhere
is
not
there
oh
exercises
oh
is
that
what
they
do
is
it
is
that
how
they
keep
fit
it
is
taking
a
long
time
to
mend
this
television
it
must
be
really
badly
broken
oh
dear
is
it
mended
yet
oh
what
are
we
going
to
do
oh
just
like
that
and
um
where
would
we
get
a
new
one
from

well
where
would
we
get
a
new
television
from

might
cost
a_lot_of
money

not
it
think
your
dad
