what
are
you

I
do
not
think

I
think
they
are
the
right
shoes
do
not
you
you

not
want
Molly
does
not
want
to
be
outside

what
she
likes
there
likes
to
be
able
to
see
right
what
is
she
got
on
Nicole
she
looks
like
she
is
got
her
best
shoes
on
does
not
she
and
she
is
got
her
little
black
and
white
skirt
on
and
a
red
jacket
I
think
they
are
her
best
clothes
do
you
means
she
is
going
to
go
out
somewhere
do
you
think
they
are
what
are
you
going
to
put
on
now
that
one
what
type
of
face
has
she
got
you
do
not
know
what
is
that
supposed
to
be
an
angry
expression
do
you
think
www
oh

is
an
angry

not
it
no
she
does
not
want
two
bodys
oh
no
she
does
not
want
two
bodys
that
wants

I
think
that
face
goes
there
actually
the
the
sad
face
with
the
tear
mhm
right
www
move
it
down
there
I
think
those
shoes
ought_to
go
there
because
that
is
her
ballet
frock
and
they
are
ballet
shoes
can
you
see
they
are
special
shoes
for
dancing
and
that
is
her
ballet
frock
www
that
is
right
that
is
their
shoe

shoes
should
we
say
yes
she
is
ready
for

too
cramped

be
not
you
there
you
have
just
got
this
one
to
put
together
now
I
think
they
look
very
very
nice
but
I
think
you
have
got
the
wrong
shoes
on
them
do
you
know
why
because
they
are
leggings
look
to
that
jumper
and
she

got
her
boots
on
and
she
is
got
her
scarf
on

put

think
if
you
look
at
her
jumper
