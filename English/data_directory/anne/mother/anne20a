that
is
an
oar
that
is
for
the

mhm
um
I
am
not
sure
what
that
is
well
I
think
that

like
that
I
think
that
is
a
ghost
think
he
is
a
ghost
a
funny
bone
does
look
a
bit
like
a
dog's
bone
there
does
not
it
where
is
the
dog
um
cannot
see
a
dog
oh
what
about
that
look
where
does
that
that
piece
is
off
the
bed
look
I
think
how
is
that
where
is
the
other
one
well
done
like

am
not

works
we
tried
to
make

health
center
oh

is
a
good
idea
he
he

got
a
poorly
leg
