www
can I make a bridge
oh thank_you
can I have some more
that's it
can the bridge go on your pattern
no
it's a very smaller one
it is isn't it
think that's big enough for the penguin to walk under
no
what about the horse
does the horse go through
oh
the horse could get under it just look
the little horse
oh
just
it's like the horse's stable
are you doing a bridge over there
what
a bridge
well
you need a long piece to do it with
really

that one's a good piece
oh
that's the other long piece isn't it
I knew there was a long piece somewhere
there
you use the long piece look
you put put some feet on it
there
can you build one with that look
put some bricks underneath
on here look
if we put those underneath
what about these look
okay
whoops
whoops
okay
there
that's a good bridge
the penguin says I can fit under that bridge
and the tiger
tiger can
and the hippo
yes
I was wondering where the baby was
he's gone
is he behind you Anne
not in there
no
that's the man
oh dear
perhaps he's at somebody else's house
he might be in the food
is he in the food
he was so hungry he was in the food
hello my Mummy

I think that little bit must have_to go further back
I think you put
go on then
you're determined to do it
we're not very clever are we Anne
Caroline'll show us
oh
that was what we didn't do
here you go
that bit goes on the top there
that's it
is that better Anne
www
that's it
you've done it
that goes in there
where's what
well
your your tunnel broke
you can build it again though
think you bumped into your tunnel and it fell over
but we can soon build it again
do you want the train to go under the tunnel then
whoops
it's not a very sturdy one
we wouldn't make construction engineers
oh
too small
make it a bit bigger
hang on
I think we've got some dynamic problems Anne
right
will it go under now
I don't know whether it will
probably not
oh
bit higher
bit taller
you know what
will it go

choo
oh
yeah
yes
thank_you for that helpful comment

well
we'll just get your horsie out because we don't want to muddle them all up do we
oh

I knew my first bridge was superior
it might be too small but it stays up
well
hang on
hang on
oh look
right
now
is that a little bit more sturdy
it's not sturdy
oh no what can the matter be
there

www
goodness gracious you
what's happened
never mind
this horse is happy because he's found his Mummy
shall we make him a field

I think we'll have a green field for the horses
just made of green bricks
could you get me some green bricks please
green bricks
Anne doesn't
www
oh
you've made a good field haven't you
here we are
it needs a door
oh
good idea
use the gate as a door
how's that
that's the same size
shut the door
need lots_of doors to stop the tigers getting out don't you
tigers are dangerous
yeah
oh
but that one's not green
it's my green field
and that one's not green
okay
that's no good
oh
that is good
does that man look after the tigers
are you alright tigers
they're a little bit hungry
they want a banana
there
pardon
what
the tiger's eating the whale
or the whale's eating the banana
pardon
the tiger's eating the whale
poor whale
poor old whale
being eaten by the tiger
just eat bananas please
you could eat some meat
shall we give him some meat
you think he might might like meat better than bananas
I think he might do
who do you think might like the banana to eat
the whale
or the monkey
and who might like some wheat or some hay to eat
the horses
the horses like that
you don't want to play with that
shall we look in here then
I'll just get a tissue Anne
pardon
did you stand on a Duplo_brick
oh whoops
where's whale gone

dolly's got her dungarees on today
where's her hair
I don't know
oh dear
I think it's lost Caroline said didn't she
oh dear
open it
you're going to see if it's in there
that's a good idea
oh
sit up dolly
go on then
have a look and see if it's in there
perhaps her hair ribbon might be in there
to tie up her hair
oh
what's that
oh
is it her pants
excuse me
have you got no pants on
oh
she's got no pants on
her pants
put your pants on under your trousers

she'll be very warm
do you think
pardon
we bought some doll's clothes for Sophie that had shoes with them didn't we
yeah
do you remember
I don't think
you haven't got any shoes for your dolly have you
I don't think this is supposed to go over the top of that blouse
think she's going to look a bit bundled up
hmm
supposed to be this alright
oh
I think that might be a bit small for your baby
don't you
you haven't really got a smaller baby
Lucy's the smallest one you've got isn't it
well
the only other one I can think of  that one
we could see
oh
hang on
hang on
is it the wrong way round
it's because her head turns round Anne
this peculiar dolly
oh
now
she looks in that doesn't she
wants her bibbie on does she
for you or for dolly
for the dollys
oh right
going going going going going going going going
I think yours ought_to because yours has got no hair has she
no
so she'll get a cold head
there
that's right
wow
