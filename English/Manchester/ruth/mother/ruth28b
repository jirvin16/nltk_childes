well
what
you
can
do
Ruth
when
you
build
houses
you
just
build
round
the
edges
and
you
leave
a
space
in
the
middle
you
seem
to
fill
in
your
houses
a
lot
let
us
let
us
take
the
middle
bricks
away
so
we
can
have
a
space
in
the
middle
we
will
just
build
the
walls
you
do
not
want
walls
look
look
there
is
some
walls
now
see
like
that
now
you
have
got
a
space
if
little
white
baby
wants
to
come
in
she
can
go
in
the
house
like
this
because
she
is
got
somewhere
to
sit
now
has
not
she
well
our
house
is
not
our
house
has
got
walls
there
look
see
now
you
have
got
a
space
for
her
and
the
only
thing
is
we
cannot
find
her
I
do
not
know
where
she
is
darling
Dutch_baby
go
in
there
okay
there
that
is
nice
I
think
she
likes
it
in
there
does
she
I
think
she
likes
it
there
you
do
not
want
a
wall
there
well
all
houses
have
got
four
walls
well
well
I
do
not
suppose
all
houses
have
most
houses
have
four
walls
well
otherwise
you
have
got
a
big
space
in
them
do
you
not
oh
you
will
have
no
house
left
in
a
minute
because
you
are
knocking
it
all
down
that
is
right
do
you
not
are
you
building
another
wall
what
are
you
building
a
wee
house
yeah
www
right
you
are
knocking
your
house
down
again
are
you
it
is
a
funny
looking
house
to
me
it
is
a
funny
looking
house
to
me
yeah
it
has
got
four
walls
again
they
are
just
very
low
they
are
not
very
high
the
walls
be
not
they
not
imagine
if
our
walls
in
our
house
only
came
this
high
all
the
wind
would
get
in
would
not
it
it
would
would
not
it
we
need
the
walls
to
be
high
and
then
you
need
a
roof
on
it
to
keep
the
wind
out
yes
we
have
got
a
roof
yeah
all
houses
need
roofs
otherwise
the
rain'll
get
in
and
it
is
been
raining
a
lot
lately
imagine
we
did
not
have
a
roof
think
how
much
rain
would
be
inside
our
house
there
would
be
lots
and
lots_of
rain
would
not
there
and
everything
would
get
very
wet
would
not
it
would
it
yeah
has
Anna
got
a
roof
Anna's
not
got
a
roof
on
her
house
I
do
not
think
she
does
I
think
she
wants
a
roof
on
her
house
a
roof
that
keeps
the
rain
out
because
some
roofs
are
very
old
and
they
leak
and
they
let
the
rain
in
well
there
is
maybe
a
hole
in
the
roof
if
there
is
a
hole
in
the
roof
it
lets
the
rain
in
we
had
a
leak
in
our
house
did
not
we
did
not
did
not
the
water
come
into
our
room
it
did
and
who
had
to
come
and
fix
it
a
man
a
workman
did
not
a
workman
come
and
fix
it
yeah
that
is
right
what
darling
