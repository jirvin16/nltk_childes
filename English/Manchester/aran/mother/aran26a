you

a
crash
does
not
just
happen
somebody
has_to
go
off
the
road
or
something
like
that
or
perhaps
this
man's
coming
too
fast
round
the
bend
and
he
goes
round
like
that
oh
smash
into
that
one
that
is
a
terrible
crash
is
not
it
but
we
do
need

the
breakdown
truck

sort
it
out

I
think

want
do
you
want
the
fire
but
Aran
the

has_to
follow
the
road
system
does
not
it
you

Bernie_the_breakdown_truck
from
the
service
station
he
is
got_to
go
round
the
one
way
system
as_well
has
not
he
all
the

here
only
he

so
much
of
a
hurry
is
he
now
there
he
is
are
these
cars
crushed
to
bits
or
are
they
just
a
little
bit
damaged
they
are
crushed

you
think
we
need
some
cutting
equipment
to
get
these
er
these
poor
men
out_of
here
yes
well
we
will
just
have_to
imagine
a
cutter
you
know
like
the
one
in
that
Fireman_Sam
book
that
Penny
has
well
we
will
have_to
pretend
that
we
have
got
something
like
that
when
you
cut
all
the
top
off
the
racing
cars
and
you
have
got
the
people
out
then
they
can
be
taken
away
cannot
they
well
the
people
are
taken
away
in
an
ambulance
go
on
will
not
will

will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will

neenaw
that
is
the
ambulance

we
put
the
people
in
the
ambulance
in
the
back
of
there
they
will
have_to
go
to
the
hospital
where
is
the

we
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
look
all
this
traffic's
building
up
is
not
it
all
this
traffic
there
is
a
great
big
traffic
queue
all
round
the
back
of
here
is
not
there
there
is
a
traffic
jam
Gumdrop
was
in
the
traffic
jam
where
is
Gumdrop
is
this
Gumdrop
right
and
where
was
Gumdrop
in
a
traffic
jam
hmm
oh
no
we
are
not
having
any
more
crashes
until
we
have
got
this
one
sorted
out
no
Gumdrop
does
not
crash
into
anything
Gumdrop
does
not
crash
things
out_of
the
way
Gumdrop
turns
off
and
goes
round
does
not
he
and
takes
a
detour
shall
we
have
this
little
man
as
a
policeman
waving
people
round
the
accident
hmm
so
he
is
pointing
to
where
to
go
you
see
you
go
round
him
do
not
you
over
there
no
not
over
there
that
is
right
in
the
middle
of
the
accident
is
not
it
come
on
you
have
got_to
go
round
that
way
there
and
everybody's
looking
to
see
what
is
happening
right
come
on
then
we
will
take
this
one
to
the
service
station
see
if
you
can
get
it
there
right
there
we
are
there
we
are
Bernie_the_breakdown_truck's
taken
him
and
they
are
going
to
put
it
on
there
on
the
ramp
just
to
see
if
it
is
worth
repairing
oh_goodness
me
it
is
in
a
state
is
not
it
I
think
the
back
axle's
gone
and
here
is
the
breakdown
truck
coming
round
again
to
get
oh
that
one's
gone
to
the
hospital
Aran
round
there
the
hospital's
round
there
and
we
will
take
this
one
as_well
to
the
garage
see
if
we
can
get
it
repaired
that
one
did
not
crash
Gumdrop
has
not
Gumdrop
never
crashes
there
you
are
that
one's
waiting
now
and
the
fire
now
he
is
used
his
cutting
equipment
he

going
back
to
the
fire
station
he
goes
back
nice
and
quietly
does
not
he
all
the
way
round
here
and
reverse
in
and
so
he
can
be
cleaned
again
cannot
he
and
have
all
his
equipment
checked
it
is
going
back
into
the
service
station
is
not
it
right
what
else
is
going
to
happen
on
our
road
system
shall
we
have
a
proper
traffic
jam
this
crane's
moving
very
very
slowly
is
not
it
everybody's
got_to
queue
behind
it
or
better
still
shall
we
have
a
bulldozer
and
a
crane
bulldozer
goes
really
slowly
does
not
it
and
everybody's
got_to
wait
have
not
they
and
here
is
Postman_Pat
Postman_Pat's
getting
rather
annoyed
because
he
wants
to
get
through
to
the
post
office
quickly
does
not
he
to
pick
up
the
post
is
he
pushing
the
crane
out_of
the
way
why
is
he
doing
that
oh
right
so
you
have
used
your
bulldozer
to
push
everybody
out_of
the
way
so
Postman_Pat
can
get
to
the
post
office
on
time
this
road
system
does
not
make
a_lot_of
sense
it
seems
to
me
to
be
rather
continental
everybody's
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
be
not
they
there
we
are
Postman_Pat's
at
the
post
office
getting
all
the
letters
to
take
to
people
is
not
he
right
come
on
where
is
Postman_Pat
going
to
first
of
all
hmm
has
he
has
he
got
the
letters
for
the
bank
the
bank
manager
what
is
the
bank
manager
called
Mister_Moneybags
hmm
there
we
are
leave
the
letters
there
is
all
sorts
of
things
there
cheques
for
the
bank
leave
those
there
go
back
we
will
go
round
here
we
will
go
to
the
hotel
what
sort
of
letters
do
you
think
Postman_Pat's
got
for
the
hotel
are
you
interested
in
what
sort
of
letters
Pat's
got
for
the
hotel
Aran
or
do
you
just
want
to
play

that
man
up
the
road
had
at
the
weekend
when
he
was
digging
his
path
up
do
you
remember
that
he
made
a_lot_of
noise
did
not
he
did
you
make
a_lot_of
noise
when
you
were
digging
the
road
up
oh
I
bet
the
people
round
about
were
not
pleased
did
they
complain
at
the
museum
the
noise
on
the
road
and
what
did
you
tell
them
you
were
very
sorry
for
the
inconvenience
but
normal
service
would
be
resumed
as_soon_as
possible
hmm
right
where
are
we
taking
all
this
rubble
where
shall
we
take
it
to
to
the
what
what
is
the
taxi
hmm
Mer_mer
goes
in
a
taxi
a
taxi
is
a
car
that
comes
to
the
house
to
take
you
somewhere
where
have
you
got
this
idea
about
taxis
oh
you
are
throwing
bread
to
the
ducks
now
I
thought
this
was
money
I
thought
this
was
treasure
well
are
you
sure
the
ducks
are
there
I
think
the
ducks
are
over
there
by
the
pond
well
there
is
the
pond
so
the
ducks
cannot
be
far
away
can
they
you
have
thrown
it
in
the
wrong
direction
have
not
you
oh
well
never
mind
perhaps
some
seagulls

get
it
or
some
magpies
what
do
you
think
or
some
pigeons
are
they
hungry
ducks
are
they
eating
all
your
bread
up
hmm
what
did
we
feed
last
time
we
went
to
Bramhall_Park
we
did
not
we
fed
something
else
it
was
a
great
big
duck
was
not
it
which
one
was
it
was
it
a
goose
oh
it
was
it
was
a
great
big
hungry
goose
was
not
it
and
the
duck
well
he
was
looking
for
something
to
eat
and
the
ducks
were
frightened
of
it
were
not
they
well
it
was
so
big
and
greedy
I
do
not
think
geese
like
ice
no
well
it
is
just
not
one
of
the
things
they
eat
they
like
bread
and
grass
and
things
like
that
water
right
where
are
we
taking
all
this
rubble
to
hmm
