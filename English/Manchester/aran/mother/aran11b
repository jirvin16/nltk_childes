then
just
put

in
the
car
like

and
he
can
sit

it
cannot
he
and
if

he
can
put

on
where
is
he
going
in
the
car
is
he
going
to
the
shops
which
shop's
he
going
to
the
big
shop
the
supermarket
what
is
he
going
to
buy
when
he
gets
there
oh
he
is
going
to
that
shop
is
he
right
that
is
a
shop
is
it
that
is
a
door
what
does
the
shop
sell
bananas
does
it
he
is
going
to
buy
some
bananas
getting
out
is
he
well
open
the
door
for
him
go
on
he
needs
some
help
opening
the
door
oh
you
need
to
open
it
a
bit
wider
than
that
Aran
oh
that
is
it
is
not
it
that
is
it
dingding
well
I
think
you
might
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
shut
that
door
because
panda's
a
bit
too
big
is
not
he
t
got
a
hole
in
well
that
is
for
his
arm
is
not
it
got_to
have
holes
in
in
t
have
not
you
one
for
your
head
and
two
for
your
arms
and
one
at
the
bottom
you
cannot
sit
in
there
you
are
too
big
she
probably
will
take
it
away
with
her
yes
I
think
we
can
say
so
but
she
might
bring
it
back
another
day
might
not
she
no
they
are
not
your
toys
they
are
just
some
toys
that
you
play
with
be
not
they
sometimes
are
you
good
at
sharing
honest
oh
is
the
panda
looking
at
the
neenaw
is
the
panda
saying
hello
to
Postman_Pat
well
I
think
that
door's
designed
for
a
smaller
panda
is
not
it
never
mind
he
can
just
have
a
look
through
the
door
cannot
he
lock
it
up
with
the
key
well
have
you
got
the
key
to
that
door
I
do
not
think
there
is
a
key
to
that
door
yes
that
is
right
you
fill
up
the
petrol
at
the
boot
end
of
the
car
do
not
you
well
I
think
the
panda
needs
a
little
bit
more
help
Aran
yes
he
cannot
really
help
himself
can
he
shall
Mummy
help
him
oh
I
think
that
car's
too
big
Aran
too
big
well
even
if
you
take
the
others
out
I
think
it
is
still
too
big
is
not
it
well
you
can
try
but
I
do
not
think
it
will
go
in
well
you
can
try
putting
it
in
the
garage
but
I
think
it
is
a
bit
big
again
is
not
it
oh
come
on
here
is
panda
he
is
got
his
t
on

the
garage
is
not
it
pardon
a
little
bit
it
only
goes
in
a
little
bit

not
it

the
panda

get
out_of
his
car

the
garage

the
car
fit
in
the
