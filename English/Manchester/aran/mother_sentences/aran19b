what do you like best about that lego Aran
the noise it makes coming out
you were asking me this morning when the naughty teddy was coming weren't you
www
no
not today
now what did we say about dolly
you love dolly don't you
nurse dolly and give her a kiss
it was stuck in her hair wasn't it
she doesn't need it
no
she doesn't need it
oh look
here's your milkman
oh excuse me please
come on
excuse me
that's better
right
that's Pingu's friend isn't it
does he
I find it difficult to find out anything that Pingu says
yes
they were playing knock and run weren't they
very naughty of them wasn't it
that poor old gentleman got very cross didn't he
shall we build Pingu's igloo then
what color's snow
green
well shall we have a white and blue one for Pingu's igloo
knock knock
that's what
you find the cow
look
here you are
here are all the animals
oh the cars aren't in here are they
no cars
well you've got plenty of cars over there anyway
why do you want to play with cars
and we went to see some cars yesterday didn't we
we went to see the sports car
and there was a Rolls_Royce in there as_well wasn't there
well you've got_to be a bit more organized Aran haven't you
that truck has_to go on there doesn't it like that
so it can move it
come on
put the coupling on
that's it
shall we play meeting the horse
where are they going to
the horse is going to drive the train is he
well I don't think you can darling
you can't have both that and
oh come on
this is the real trailer for the train isn't it
here you are
do you want horsie to go on there
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
and then you can put that carriage on the back
there we go
hadn't you better get somebody to drive this train
hmm
what about this little man here
does he want to drive the train Aran
or is he going to stand on the back and look after the horsie
oh the penguin's driving the train now is he
but there's two little men here
can they have a drive
the penguins
oh there's somebody else here that wants to drive
the penguins are going to do it are they
well I'm afraid he's too tall
that's the trouble isn't it
he's too tall
are you going to have one of those little men in there
that's a better idea
I think those little men'll be better at driving than Pingu
go on
are you driving them round to Pingu's igloo
that man's riding the horse is he
oh he's a clever man isn't he
yes he will
if you put him on right
you see he's not looking the right direction
no wonder you can't get it on
here you are
are you driving them round to the igloo then
should we make this igloo a bit taller
is that where it goes
hmm
you're making Pingu feel at home are you
oh you've dropped a brick in
no wonder there's not enough room for Pingu
and you want that cow to go in as_well
I don't honestly think there's enough room for a cow in Pingu'shouse at all
the cow's going to eat Pingu
and there's a horse in there as_well
did you know that
is it
going to
oh is that the shark that's going to eat dolly up
whoops
eats dolly's toes up does it
oh poor dolly
has she got nibbled toes now
and who's going to make her better
those are barriers to keep the animals in aren't they
you're keeping Pingu in
it can go anywhere you like
here we are
two barriers
you've got_to climb over them both to get out_of that house now haven't you
hmm
that's Pingu's igloo isn't it
well as near as Mummy can make it anyway
do you like Pingu's igloo
all blue and white isn't it
it's frosty and snow
and look
here's some fish for Pingu's tea
Pingu always eats fish
did you see him fishing yesterday
hmm
did you see that naughty seal keep taking his fish
Pingu's come out has he
where's he going now
oh he's eating the fish is he
mm
he's had something to eat and he's going back in again now is he
he's going to take it in with him
is he going to share it with his friend
that one's fallen over
it has hasn't it
look
here's your friend the elephant
I don't think there's any room in Pingu's friend for an elephant
don't don't you think it don't you think the elephant'd be rather cold in all that frost and snow
elephants like warm places don't they
mhm
shall we have somewhere else over here for the elephant
a warm place for the elephant
the elephant and the hippo and the tiger
they like warm places don't they
where do they have_to go
you want to put them by Pingu
hmm
