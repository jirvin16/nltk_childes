he's pushing all the snow away
well could he push an apple in my direction
is that an apple
is it
that's a volcano
Terence is doing some heavy shifting work here isn't he
he's a bit tired today is he
well he's got that in common with a_lot_of us hasn't he
why is Terence tired today
no
he didn't have much sleep last night
did he wake up early
this morning
he did did he
couldn't he get back to sleep
didn't I
what was I doing
hmm
I was snoring was I
that's what stopped Terence going back to sleep again
oh poor Terence
come on then Terence
you come and move this apple for me
oh crunch crunch
I'll get the apple for you Mummy
there we are
there's the apple
now Terence is going to get me two balloons
we had a lovely balloon this morning didn't we until Daddy broke it didn't he
that lovely red one that the end fell off
a big one wasn't it
that red one
well come on
give me the balloons please
let Terence move the balloons
that's right
I bet Sarah_Greeves can do this faster than you Aran
mhm
Sarah_Greeves can read can't she
hmm
oh it's my turn is it
right
well what shall I go for
oh
I might not want that
no
I don't want a volcano
I'm going to go for that clown
because the clown comes next
it's c for clown isn't it
c for clown
oh what a lovely clown
he's got red shoes on hasn't he
right
what are we having next
I think you should have a d for duck next
shouldn't you
Terence is going to get the duck
quackquack
oh has that duck flown away
just as Terence was going to get it as_well
is it going to land on Terence's bonnet
or on his caterpillar tracks
did it break when it fell on that caterpillar track
has Terence got egg all over him
has he
oh
and what are we looking for now
well what do we want this for
oh look
oh to wash Terence
right
okay
there we are
you'd better take Terence then hadn't you
I think Terence is going in the wrong entrance there darling
does Terence need any diesel fuel in the back
hmm
oh well we'd better get him filled up hadn't we
is he tired after pulling Bertie_the_postbus out_of the snow
I thought he would be
I thought to myself
you know when we went when we saw Bertie_the_postbus coming back in the snow
I thought Terence is going to be tired after that job isn't he
there we are
there's the ramp
is Terence going to climb up the ramp
gosh
this is dusty Aran
because we haven't been playing with it have we
well I thought he was going through the carwash
hmm
well if Terence could come down the ramp
yes
he's not as good as the other cars is he
because
does your nose want blowing
it sounds as though it does
come on
come on
you wind Terence through the carwash
explain to Terence what's happening that he's going through those rollers isn't he
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
and have you have you got him through the carwash
has the egg come off
oh jolly good
a bit has
and again
that's it
that bit didn't
well you'd better put him through the carwash again hadn't you
are you sure you're operating this carwash properly
I'm not convinced of this at all
right
go on
has Terence has Terence been in
and what what do you think you're doing
Aran
but Terence doesn't use petrol
Terence uses diesel
are you sure you've got the right one out_of the right pump
because it's no use putting unleaded petrol into Terence when he uses diesel
is it
are you sure
well I think he is you know
all right
you try putting some petrol in but don't blame me if Terence breaks down will you
hmm
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
say that again
it's the what
the petrol he asked for
oh right
go on then
is his tank full
how much
gallons and gallons
and how much do these gallons of petrol cost
twenty pounds worth of petrol
got a big tank hasn't he
now had you better put him through the carwash again to make sure that egg's come off him
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there we are
come on
wind him through
oh come on
I think you'd better rub over Terence with a window leather
go on
I'll do it
give him a good polish
oh do you know
I think Terence is a lot better now isn't he
don't you think he looks nice and shiny
no
a bit of egg on his nose
well are you going to wipe it off
has he got_to go back through the carwash again
I thought he might have
here's Terence
he's coming now
oh that's a modern tractor isn't it
you see Terence is a very old tractor isn't he
that's why he's different
what's happening now
the tractor's turn for what
well he's not on the ramp is he
he's in the car lift
and I think he's just had a serious accident by falling off
you've got_to be a bit more careful haven't you
or else you're going to get some big compensation claims aren't you
from the insurance
it's your negligence if they've fallen off the car lift
isn't there going to be trouble Aran
that's not how you do it is it
you know that
well that tractor's going to be suspended in mid air
it can't get down now can it
no
nobody can reach it
it's just like that time Bella got stuck in the lift isn't it
and what did they do then
can't you remember when Bella went shopping
and Rosa ran away
and Bella got locked in the shop over night
and she thought that she could get to the entrance by using the lift
and all the electricity was switched off wasn't it
and Bella was stuck in the lift
oh look
we've got it sorted out now Aran
what is it you want
which car
that's Ben's car and that's Ben driving it is it
Ben
Bernie
Ben
right okay
right okay
right okay
now what's that car doing
where's my little blue Volkswagen
oh he's up here
here's Mummy's car
can Mummy come and do some shopping in the high rise carpark
hmm
and what's Ben doing up there
I thought this was Mummy's Volkswagen
oh
is there any room on the middle station
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right
I can just get on there behind
oh the tractor's fallen off
come on
oh I think I'm going to park next_to Ben
oh Ben's gone
well I'm going to park up here because I'm going to Marks_and_Spencers
oh
well I'm not paying for entrance to your carpark then
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I want to park and go to Marks_and_Spencers
and I want to go to Edward_Meeks as_well for some new sandals for my little boy
and I think I'll call at MacDonald's
I'll have a cup of tea and I'll go and play in the ball pool
this is what
that's MacDonald's is it up there
that's where you get a cup of tea is it
what are you going to have then Aran if you're going into MacDonald's
orange juice

I've been to Edward_Meeks with my little boy and I've had my cup of tea
I've been in the ball pool
and I'm going back to the high rise carpark for my car
and what am I going to find when I get to the top story
somebody's stolen my car
somebody's stolen my car
well I left it just there and it's not just there now
so Mister_carpark attendant

well you naughty carpark attendant
where've you parked my car

oh
what's this
you've been riding it up and down the car ramp haven't you
right
well I'm going to take my car
I'm going to take it to this petrol station
and I'm going to I'm going to have it examined and if there's so much as a scratch on it so much as a scratch I'm going to send for Mister_Plod

and what do we find right away
what do we find right away
yes
damage to the bumper
come and look
I'll show you where the damage to the bumper is
you're going to fix it at once are you
with that spanner
do you think that'll be sufficient
well I don't think so because there's a bit missing off my bumper there
you must have knocked it off
on your way out_of the carpark mustn't you
did you
don't be silly with that Aran
right
well I shall drive my Volkswagen home for tea then
ring ring ring

and I shall say what's all this then young fellow me

I hear you've taken this lady's Volkswagen and driven it away
some baddies did it
what were their names
one was what
one was a tiger
is that what you said
well what did you say
I couldn't hear you Aran
one was a man and one was a what
come on
tell me about these baddies that stole this car
some baddies didn't do it
well who did then
who
some robbers did it
what were their names
one was a dragon
was he breathing fire
what color was he
green
and who was the other robber
Robbie
Pingu's friend
well that's very helpful isn't it
that's very helpful indeed
we know exactly who we're looking for now don't we
Robbie told the dragon to do it did he
a
so Robbie's the most important robber isn't he
he's the one that's that's planned it all isn't he
right so I think we should go and look for him first
don't you
where do you think we're going to find him
in the ditch
looking for his friend Pingu
in a ditch
where is this ditch
is it in the countryside
near a farm
right
which farm
your farm
right okay
right okay
your pretend farm
where is that
just over there
right
well I shall go and look for Robbie and this dragon
should I
I can't see them
I think they've run away
no
they're not under there
and they're not behind here
they must have run away
there they are
can you get them for me
that'll do
come on
come down
right
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right
come on
what have I told you about this Aran
you're too big for this now
come on
yes you are
come out please
are these the two robbers in a car
right
okay
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
shall we put them with the goblins
come on then
you come down and play now
right
well that will do
all this what's making you tired
are you going to lie down and go to sleep then
right
well I'll play with some more cars
I'm going to have the delivery van
it's going to come up and it's going to make some deliveries to Marks_and_Spencers
is that Gumdrop
well he can still make deliverys to Marks_and_Spencers can't he
what do you think he's delivering
chips
do Marks_and_Spencers sell chips
I don't think they do
come on
you come and play then
and beans
and here's the rubbish cart
and it's going to empty all the recycling plants that are located in the carpark isn't it
what are you going to do with Gumdrop
right
he's going to Morrison's because he's got some doughnuts to deliver
what sort of doughnuts are they
what have they got inside them
apple
my very favorites
I think you've had a breakdown there
you've lost a wheel
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
have you got your tools
you'd better put Gumdrop on the ramp hadn't you
or else you're not going to be able to raise him sufficiently to get his wheel back on
do you want Mummy to help
that's not the ramp is it
the ramp's over there isn't it
you know that full well
this garage is wasted on you
well if you're putting a wheel on a car you can't just suddenly pick the back up with one hand can you
you've got_to use a jack or you've got_to put it up on a ramp haven't you
and then you can put the wheel back on
do you want Mummy to help you putting put the wheel back on
what are you getting
your tools
and what sort of tools do you need
right okay
one hammer
one drill
one set of pliers
right
you have a look close look at Gumdrop's wheel
broken is it
what's happened
has the wheel come off
or is it just the tyre
oh well I think you can fix that then can't you
I don't I don't think that is what happened is it
the tyre came off Gumdrop didn't it
come on
Mummy's good with tools
she'll help you put it back
oh actually I think we might have more problems than first appeared
right
you're good at using tools
well if I put this tyre back in position can you hammer it on
right okay
right
it's just in position
now what it wants is it needs hammering and then it needs a squeeze with the pliers
that back wheel there
that one
just give it a hammer
make sure that tyre's tightly on
and can you squeeze it with your pliers
is that for the wheel nuts
why are you handcuffing it
oh
well that's novel
does P_C_Selby know you've got his handcuffs in your tool
Arthur_Selby
Greevesdale's policeman
well can I have my handcuffs then
and you can use the pliers on your wheel
I'm not too happy about my my handcuffs being taken like this at all I'm not
I might have needed these for those two robbers that have been stealing cars from the carpark
are those the ones you repaired Grandma's beads with
hmm
are you sure that's the right wheel Aran
is it all done now
right
well what are you going to steal
well my blue Volkswagen's never reappeared has it
I'm very
now if you pull that hard you'll break it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you can't steal petrol pumps
in a petrol station the petrol pumps are concreted into the ground so you can't steal them
well you still can't steal petrol pumps
what use are petrol pumps
what's Terence going to do now
is he going to move some more of those boulders over there
is that the building site
a
you're going to steal a tractor are you
oh well that's quite different isn't it
you get in trouble for stealing tractors can't you
poor Terence
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
well you tell me where the keys are
well you're the driver
and anyway if you're a robber you don't need keys do you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh well I don't know what you did with your handcuff key
