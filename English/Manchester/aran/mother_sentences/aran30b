I think we'd better put your animals out_of the way

I think we'll have_to turn to yellow
we don't seem to have many blue and white blocks do we
shall we put it on here
it's easier if you put it on here isn't it
yes it is
because it all sticks together doesn't it then
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
goodness me Aran
we've hardly got anywhere yet
where
here
let's have it matching
let's have one on the other side as_well
on there
one there
and
build it up a little bit more
that's the entrance is it
so nobody can get in
carefully guarding the entrance are you
where do you want them
well do we not need them for the roof
hmm
oh dear
I'm not sure I've I'm not sure I've got this right
not sure this is quite how you do it
is that another one now at the entrance to stop the baddies getting in
right
that's jolly good isn't it
there we are
there's Pingu's igloo
where's Pingu
here's Pingu
is this Pingu's friend
Pingo
he's going in too is he
well no
I think there are only two Pingus aren't there
just two
whoops
right
well let's have a bit more on this side
well you've put them both inside haven't you
oh dear
it's all falling to bits isn't it
no well you should have chosen a better builder than mummie then shouldn't you
right
that's it isn't it
Pingu's igloo
and Pingu and his friend Pingo are inside
are you putting those hens in there
aren't you afraid they're going to freezer to death
it's very cold at the south pole isn't it
pardon
now if you're too strong on it Aran it will collapse
where do you want that to go
right on the top
let's have it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there we are
that's Pingu's igloo
what are we going to do now
is this this little man that comes along
zzz
with that sort of little electric car and takes people all about on the snow
do you remember when Pingu went to that sort of museum
well that picture gallery
where they had those sculptures and those pictures
and Pingu and Robbie upset one of the sculptures didn't they
and all that that one that was a mother and baby fell to pieces didn't it
and they rearranged it to be a horse
do you remember that one
you said you didn't like that one
you do
I thought you didn't
mhm
right
what's happening in Pingu's igloo
is he having a party
why are they having a party
is it somebody's birthday
how old is he
twenty
I didn't know Pingu was that old
I really didn't
I thought he was younger than that
are you sure
I thought that Pingu was younger than that because Pingu still goes to school doesn't he
so how can he be twenty if if he's going to school
because he just wants to
right so is he having a cake with twenty candles on
he wants to go in in the snow does he
Pingo
I suppose so
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right
where are they going
are they going to that picture gallery again
are they
or are they going fishing
or have they got their sledges with them
are they going swimming
are you sure you get sharks at the south pole
hmm
oh you've saved Pingu and Pingo have you by dealing with the shark
oh I think they  better go home now for a cup of tea
I think they've both been very frightened haven't they by that shark
oh
Pingu is being brave isn't he
has he dealt with that shark now
hmm
has he
shall we make his igloo even bigger
think it will fall down
yes
take what
you want those bits off do you
what
both the green and the red
or just the green
right okay
well let me have a look inside
oh there's a funny collection of animals in that igloo
there really is
yes
you put another brick on
yes you can
yes
that's right
yes
yes
that's a funny shaped one isn't it
oh it is a tall igloo isn't it
it doesn't look like an igloo at all now does it
what does it look like
a church is it with a steeple
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
it's all going to come down
that's it
is it a church with a steeple
and another steeple
are the witches going to fly around your steeples
oh thanks
oh
careful now
go on
I'll hold the bottom
oh it is a tall steeple isn't it
oh is that it now
is that the spire on the top
oh even more
oh well you've got_to be careful now Aran because
well
that's it
well it's a very funny shaped steeple this is
very funny indeed
is that the lightening conductor at the top
oh dear
oh
I think it'd be better if we took that one off wouldn't it
looks more like a crane than a steeple to me
is that
oh dear
no
you've not got it in the right place Aran
as a temporary measure
well you were warned weren't you
let's start again
right
come on
we can go on now can't we
see how high we can get it
what color's that one
I thought it might be
no
you need to pull it a bit nearer to you Aran
there we are
is that it
I don't think that one's going to go on
you've got it you've not got it on right Aran
this steeple's wobbling again
do you want mummie to help you with that one
that's it isn't it
gosh
that's huge isn't it
isn't it tall
it's really big isn't it
it's a very funny igloo though isn't it
is that his television aerial
are you sure
does Pingu watch television
what's his favorite program
Tots_tv
or is it Sooty
Sooty
do you like Sooty
you have haven't you
I think if you want to put any more on Aran you're going to have_to stand up aren't you because it's so high
mhm
I know what the next step is
well you have your drink
it's over there
but can you put them back now Aran
well you're a big boy now and I think you should be able to put them back
you should be able to tell which is the biggest one
and put them back on in order shouldn't you
which is the biggest one
no
that's not the biggest one
there's one bigger than that
right
well put that one on first
now find the pink one because that was the next biggest
no
that's not the next biggest
you know it isn't
right
that's the next one
right
now find the blue one
no
that's not blue
no
you know it's not
yes it is
right
now the green one
now you know green
now the yellow
then the orange
no
that's not that's not orange
that's red
that's orange
and the red one
yes
but can you do it by yourself
right
well you show me how it's done then
you tell me what colors you're putting on
what color's that one
no
that's not the next one
no
you can't force it
you see you've got it all wrong haven't you
well what about the three you haven't put on
find the pink one
that's the purple one
no
the pink one's the one next_to your hand
the pink one's the one next_to your bottom
people think you're funny if you go round saying that blue is pink
no
no go
oh I knew you couldn't do it
try taking that blue one off
well because it's not the right one is it
doesn't look quite right does it
what's wrong with it Aran
you've missed the green one
well you've not got that right have you
