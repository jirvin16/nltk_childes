willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there's no point in getting cross because there's no space is there
go on
you can put another layer of bricks on top can't you
go on
blow
that wasn't such a good blow was it
shall we try again
get those bricks out
yes that's right
mhm
what else are you putting in then if the bricks have come out
all your cars going in are they
you've dropped your truck have you
are you putting all those in the box
what's that
that's Gumdrop is it
what's that
right
that's a truck that's in
what else is going in
what's that
it's not a lawnmower
that's a roller isn't it
what's this
that's a car is it
it's a racing car
that's a horse isn't it
it's drawing a van isn't it
is that it
oh that's the crane isn't it
we seem to have lost the crane don't we
what're you after Aran
www
oh I think this crane's broken Aran isn't it
that's why we took it off isn't it
oh dear
never mind
if you're gentle with it it'll stay on
but I don't suppose you will be gentle with it will you
here you are
you can put them in your box now can't you
go on then
there's more room in that box
mhm
that's the crane isn't it
be careful with it
does does does does does does does does does
it's so the crane can lift things from different angles can't it
are you putting the milkman away as_well
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right thank_you
yes it's that end isn't it
it wasn't one of my better buys this was it
in fact I think you chose it didn't you
it wasn't me at all
there we are
that's the way it moves round isn't it
so the crane can pick things up at any angle
you put it in there
is there enough room for you as_well_as the crane
hmm
well take the crane out then
you don't want to sit on it do you
you'll get Daddy to stick it back
I don't think Daddy can stick it back to be honest
he might be able to repair it with an elastic band mightn't he
yes well I don't think it actually needs a screwdriver does it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you've done it have you
you did it did you
I think we know what happened now
come on
what else what else are you going to do now
yes well what about your milkman or what about Gumdrop or some of these other cars
mhm
a man will go in there
there's only there's only your tractor that has a man on it
oh no
that digger's got a man inside it hasn't it
mhm
I don't think any of the others have got
oh there's a bus that's got a driver isn't there
I don't think any of the rest of them have got drivers have they
no
I think the man must have got out mustn't he
when the crane broke he decided that there wasn't a job there for him anymore didn't he
are you sure
well you can't go around in you can't drive around a crane that's broken can you
the man must have got out mustn't he
well you can put it in the window but if you forget where you've put it and you lose it what's going to happen
don't expect me to remember where you've put it will you
in there
is that the garage
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I should ask Grandma actually
she might have a hot line to Father_Christmas's garage list
mightn't she
come on
you've put the crane in haven't you
put it all in together in the garage
well let Mummy help you then
if we move the crane to one side then
so there's a bit more space I think the bus might just go in
yes there we are
just about
oh no
I don't think it's going to shut
see if that crane'll fit round the corner
there
put the crane round the corner there
and then the bus
put it the other way and see if it fits better
oh there you are
night_night bus
what
oh
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh
do they all come out the bottom
don't any of them get stuck
I think they've all come out haven't they
there's a lady
there's a brick
there's another brick
oh the red bricks have got stuck haven't they
yes the red bricks are stuck
it's because they're a funny shape isn't it
no
they've not gone down completely
all stuck
oh there they are
they've all come out
the green bricks are stuck now aren't they
you'll get them out will you
no
I don't think it'll come out will it
funny shape again isn't it
it's a bit too big to turn the corner that I think Aran
there we are
green brick's come out at the bottom
where's a clean handkerchief
oh you are a horrid little boy
aren't you
come on
let's blow that nose never mind throwing that balloon
we play with balloons at Tumble_Tots don't we
oh there it goes
that was you was it
will they all go down the chimney
that's the only thing that really does go down the chimney isn't it
and all the rest
oh I don't know whether that'll go down
oh yes
here we are
it's come out hasn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there isn't enough room for the bus if you put all the cars in is there
the crane's still in there
it's round the corner
put the bus in and let's see if we can
I don't think it will
willn't willn't willn't willn't
there's not enough room for the bus as_well is there
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
right there you are
you can put the bus in now can't you
give it a push
that's it
are you going to close the garage door
you've got the man out
he has_to go down the chimney does he
well I think you'll find there isn't quite enough space with the little man in
we'll put him on the bus and then there's enough space isn't there
here we are
byebye
close the garage door
you want to put those in there as_well do you
well I think they might go in if you put them in the bus yes
that might go in as_well yes
I wouldn't put too much in
oh the milkman's got stuck
right
Mummy's managed to get it out hasn't she
well what are you going to do
put it down again
he's allowed to be a passenger in the bus is he
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
if you try and push that down Aran it'll burst
it'll go in the garage if you want
just about
yes it does go in just about
yes you've got your toys
come and play with your lego
come and build something with your lego instead of just putting it down that chimney
what shall we do
you're going to hurt yourself if you do that Aran
now be careful
we've played this game before and we've had an accident haven't we
yes those'll go in
all those in the house
are you putting all your bricks
oh here you are Aran
Aran
you've got a ladybird in your hair
oh here it is
a little ladybird
no
well I don't think it's a good idea
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I'm not sure it wants to go out at this time of year but never mind
