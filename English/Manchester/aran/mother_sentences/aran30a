let's find a wheel nut
have you got a wheel nut
what's wrong with this tractor
it's Percy_the_Dexter is it
and what have you got_to do to it
we've lost one of the pins that puts the wheels on
look
we've got one white one there
one white one there
and one white one there
and we haven't got one for this have we
what are we going to do
shall we look in that box and see if there's one there
let's put this puzzle over here then
have you
have you found it
come on
bring it here and I'll help you look
Aran
carefully now
it's still not the right one is it
none of these will do because none of these are white ones are they
bring the box and let's have a look what's in the box
there
there we are then
right
come on
have you got your screwdriver or your spanner ready
have you
where's this going
where've you put it
oh it goes there does it
and what goes on it
right
you put that on then
what's missing
that repaired is it now
you seem to be short of something
there were some baby birds weren't there on our windowsill
I hope the pussycat's not going to get our baby birds
come on
what are we short of to repair this tractor
hear one what
what's it saying
tweet tweet
is that a baby bird you can hear
come on
come and play with Mummy
and what can you see out_of the window then that you can't see from here
hmm
are my flowers growing
have any of them come out
lots_of them
I can only see one
what color is it
I think there's just one red one Aran
I think you're imagining it
mhm
not made it up
all right then
I'll believe you
come on then
come and play
look
come and put this tractor right
yes
we can hear some birds
yes
they might be
doesn't like pigeons no
your Uncle_John doesn't like pigeons either does he
yes
I don't think he's ever actually hit one but still
come on
we don't want you to hide Aran
we want you to come and play with us
no
now
well that's what you get for being silly isn't it
I thought we were repairing the tractor
I'm not sure you deserve to be kissed better because you were being silly
right well you put the wheel on Percy_the_Dexter
you show me how you can do it
right
where's the wheel
well you don't leave all your tools inside Percy_the_Dexter do you
what have you taken these wheels off for anyway
come on
are we putting this wheel on here
did you help Daddy with the wheels off Percy_the_tractor
that's my fingers you're banging
right
are you sure we've got the best tyres on here
have we
well it seems a bit unsafe to me
it looks a remarkable wobbly wheel that does
well that's not running at all well is it
I think we might have_to have another try
let's have another go
no
I think it's going to be a wobbly wheel forever
there seems to be a bit more clay on that one doesn't there than there is on the others
let's turn it upright and see if it
oh that's all right isn't it don't you think
well I don't think you're going the right way about it to fix it Aran
well I think brute force isn't quite the answer is it
don't you think you'd be a bit better with a bit of mechanical expertise
not again
right well is this tractor fixed then
right
are we going to have a smokestack on it
I'm not
that's the engine
the seat's up there
well it's not very useful to have a smokestack sticking out_of a seat is it
yes
right
you've put it
that's a very good idea
shall we have a a nut on the bottom to stop it wobbling about
you don't want a wobbly smokestack do you
are you sure it quite needs that Aran
right
there we go
well I think you are banging it
never mind can you
all right
that'll do now
come on
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
at all
right
you've fixed it now
what're you going to do Farmer_Reed
you don't know
what do you need a tractor for then
has it got a bucket on it
oh
it's got a snowplow on it
are you going to er clear the track up to your farm
get all the snow off it
I'm sure the seat's the other side Aran
I'm sure Daddy intended the other side to be the seat
I beg your pardon
what was all that about
pardon
you've got your tool yes
it's got no tools in it though has it
hmm
right
what are you doing now Farmer_Reed
are you er going to put a grass cutter on the back of that or a seed drill
well you  better start thinking hadn't you

what have you done
were you up early
what time
yeah
half past five was it
come on
have you fed the chickens this morning
did you get many eggs
how many
I'm not being rude Farmer_Reed but I really think that you ought_to trade that tractor in for a new model
because I think that it's not quite big enough for you
what do you think
you don't want to
wouldn't you like to trade Percy_the_Dexter for a brand new international
a red one
what about a green one with a muffler
the muffler at the back
that magically went down
mhm
you weren't too pleased when you did it were you
come on
what's your next task on the farm then
the sheep
what are you going to do with the sheep
take all their coats off when it's sunny
are you going to shear them then
zzz
have you got your shearing scissors ready
so you're not going to do it
oh
you think that the sheep still need their coats do you
right
well then if you're not going to shear the sheep what are you going to do
what's your next job on the farm
and what are you going to do to the cows
well that's not a job then if you're not doing anything is it
how about milking them
mhm
well then you haven't got any cows have you if they've all died
what did they die of
they ate something that they sleep on
I thought it was guinea that did that
you haven't had any guinea at all
no
Daddy did a long time ago
did it die
well come on then
what else is there on the farm for you to look after
you've fed the chickens
you're not shearing the sheep today
you're not you're not going to er milk the cows
so what what where's Dobbin the farm horse
