can I take it off
well how am I going to make Pingu's igloo then
all right
we'll use these bricks then
we're making Pingu's igloo are we
here we go then
you've got all those to make sure that no baddies get in have you
oh well that's jolly good isn't it
well how can I put it on that board when you've just forbidden me to do so
hmm
you said I couldn't
well you said dolly was using it
you said I couldn't have it
so no baddies get in
what about you
aren't you a baddie
are you sure
oh
I don't think she's a baddie at all
dolly wasn't a baddie until she met you
they're what
is that it
or is it the one this one
right
are you going to use that to transport
is that your snow mobile
hmm
are you going to use it to transport all those things
all those barriers to stop baddies getting into Pingu's igloo
right
that's the way to do it isn't it
I'm having a bit of trouble with Pingu's igloo
I haven't got enough proper bricks
I know what it is
that one should be a bit further forward shouldn't it
what are those things you've just put in
right
here's Pingu's igloo
well nearly
there you are
is Pingu going in
and no baddies get in
oh shall we put two Pingus in
hmm
Pingu and Pingu's friend are in there are they
well Mummy's got them here
they sailed away for a year and a day until they met me
what happened when they met me
came to the land where the bong tree grows did they
sounds a bit warm for penguins that
some fences
some barriers
right
are you going to fix them Mister_Reed
well you do you fix them then
go on
you get them fixed at the front
one two three
right yes
that's jolly good isn't it
how many more
and how many have you got now
one two three four
there you want it
right
the baddies are going to have difficulty now aren't they
no
they can't get in can they
and Pingu's igloo's getting bigger all the time
what are those bricks for
what are they for
no
Pingu's not a pirate is he
hmm
well if he's got cross on his house he must be a pirate mustn't he
going going going going going going going going going
mhm
there's a little something wrong with the construction of this igloo
he's going to say oh dear
my house has fallen to bits
whose house is it
oh all right then
he's going to say oh dear
Pingu's house has fallen to bits isn't he
that's what he's going to say
there we are
we've managed to effect a repair
oh dear
oh yes
we've knocked the barriers down haven't we
we'd better build the barriers up again hadn't we
what sort of baddies did you have in mind
no
I suspect not
shall we have a banana on the roof
why not
don't bananas grow in the South_Pole
oh you don't know do you
you don't know
you don't know whether they grow
do you get lions in the South_Pole
bit off course
about what
well shall we put the lion on the front of the house
oh here we are
here's the lion on the front of the house
that's very attractive isn't it
well you've pulled half the roof off as_well
not entirely sensible was it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh well that looks like a marvelous little cabin for Pingu and his friend to sit in doesn't it
hmm
where are the monkey and the horse and the lion going now
do we still need this barrier
where's their home
Africa
the cow's gone in has it
Aran
I think you just
destroying it all again
now what are we getting so cross about
hmm
what are we talking about
now don't be silly
what are you doing with those animals
come on
shall I take this to bits for you
well I'm not sure
there you are
shall we have a snake on the back
oh dear
oh don't be silly
well this is a jolly good house for Pingu isn't it
do you like it
oh dear
what's wrong with it
it's the what
chimney
well let's build one then
there
that'll do as a chimney
do you want it a bit higher
can you see all the smoke coming out
well like what then
stop being so silly
I bet poor Anna's wishing she  never come in
having to listen to you for a good hour
come on
put the barriers up again at the front door
come on
Mummy's made this little overhang
there
well we can just slide the barriers underneath like that look
it keeps things really safe that does
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
a pig though
