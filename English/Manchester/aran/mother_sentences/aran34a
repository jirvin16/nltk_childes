I'm just painting my ceiling today but it's very difficult because I can't reach
you think that tin of paint's empty
well I'm not sure Pat
you be very careful with it
I'll hold it then
are you going to look at it
come on then
I can't get the lid off
you'll have_to get the lid off this tin so awe can see if there  any paint inside
oh dear Pat
you dropped paint all down your trousers
here you are
have this rag to rub it off
I think it's making it worse too isn't it
it's rubbing it in instead of rubbing it off
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
are you going home for a clean pair of trousers Pat

I'm Sarah
oh Pat
what have you done to your trousers
can't she
so how do you get paint on your trousers
Granny_Dryden can't reach the ceiling
so what did you do
you thought the tin was empty
and wasn't it
when you took the lid off
what happened
did paint fall all down your trousers
what a mess
have you come home for your spare trousers
well you can't have them
because I've taken them to the dry cleaner's in Pancaster
yesterday
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
what are you going to do
you look in the airing cupboard
there might be an old pair of trousers in there
you go and see Pat
what are we looking at
have you been in the airing cupboard Pat
and what have you found
the ones you do the gardening in
they look more like shorts than trousers
they do
oh you do look funny Pat
everybody's going to laugh at you
still
those are better than nothing
hello Pat
are you going on your holidays
well why have you got your shorts on then
shorts you do the gardening in
haven't you got any proper trousers
why not
did she

and have you only got one pair of trousers
Granny_Dryden couldn't reach her ceiling
so what did you do Pat
you were going to give her some help with the ceiling
well I tell you what
I'll come and help this evening
you and I we'll both go to Granny_Dryden's
see you there at seven o'clock with a set of ladders and we'll paint the ceiling together
it'll be done in two ticks
hello Pat
oh those are a fetching pair of Bermuda shorts you have on
is there a special reason for this
well what is this reason Pat
haven't you got any proper trousers Pat
well I think you should complain to the G_P_O and ask for more uniform
you can't go round in Bermuda shorts like that in all weathers
aren't you cold
what are they
oh well I can see they are now you mention it
where are your proper trousers
oh I see Pat
I see
but I still think you need some new trousers from the G_P_O
don't you

while you're on the way
she needs it
she's got some visitors coming
she's asked me to borrow some sheets

the chickens might peck your legs
why are you wearing shorts today
it's not very warm

oh really
well they're not very long trousers are they
stuck for words
what does she need to reach her ceiling for
you're going to help her with the ceiling

well we've got lots_of old jars of paint tins of paint in in the barn
why don't you go and see
yes
that's the barn

you've banged yourself on the head

and straw stuck in your hair and all over your uniform
what's Sarah going to say when you get home
come on
let me brush your uniform for you
hello Pat

they're too short and they don't look particularly clean and now you're covered in straw as_well
and you've got a big bang on your head
