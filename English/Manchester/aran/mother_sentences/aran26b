carefully
right okay
we've got it all out now haven't we
now what're you going to build
a what
a building site
right
come on then
you put the bricks on
they're all together
what are you building on the building site
hmm
Aran
what are you building on the building site
of course you can get the bricks on
you're just being silly about it aren't you
come on
what is it we're building
hmm
it's what
there's dolly's slippers
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
and you know that
what are we building
a skyscraper
what is it
people don't just build on building sites you know
they are actually making something
like they're building a house
it's getting bigger
I can see that
well it will go on if you put it on correctly
no
you know that
you've got_to get it on square
and who's that on the top
Mister_Intrepid
he likes going in high places does he
well when she's stayed with us for a while
then she'll go
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
hmm
what is it then
a great big tower
is it a grain silo on the farm
I thought it might be
Howard_Harvestor
it is big now isn't it
so you've got_to make that one big
well you'd better find some of those bigger bricks hadn't you
making that one bigger
a wicked snake
they're very what
very wicked
don't you think it's getting a bit dangerous that tower
no
you don't think so
I wouldn't like anybody to fall off it
I thought you were going to make the other one the same size
well I think you might find that a bit difficult
you'll have_to put that on the middle bit
well wouldn't you be better with some of those larger bricks
get that green one
oh is that Billy_Bones on the top
what is it then
come on
here you are
use some of these bigger ones here
there you are
there are lots_of bricks Aran
if you want to build a really high tower isn't there
aren't there
do you want me to help you
hmm
a bit bigger and a bit bigger still
I can't wait to see what happens in the end when you get right to the top
how tall  it going to be when you get it right to the top
one metre or two metres
mhm
well that's a good idea isn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh is it
yes
I'm not surprised
yes but I think you've got I think you've got a problem of logistics here
no
you've got round it have you
come on
let me help you
there we are
oh it is getting high isn't it
oh you might run out_of bricks in a minute mightn't you
there's some behind you here
nobody's behind you
it's just some bricks isn't it
well there's some by your knee aren't there
well you've you've put must have put them on the tower
keep going
oh they're both the same size now aren't they
it's that man next isn't it
pardon
no
it isn't Missis_Robert
that's Mister_Scrang next
but I think he'll let you call him Edward if you really want
Edward
yes but don't tell him
he might be upset if he thinks he's disturbing us
pardon
he shouldn't be what
making a noise
no
well perhaps not
well he's making something isn't he
or repairing something
or maybe he's tidying something up
oh dear
shall we put it up again
there we are
it's getting higher and higher Aran isn't it
do you think you can get all the bricks onto your towers
you think so do you
it's getting a bit of a funny shape this
whoops
go on
shall we put it back up again
silly Mummy
well actually it would be do you think it would be better if we put it up like that
right
there we are
come on
a bit more on that one
oh which one's the tallest now
actually I think we might be a bit better on this
if you put them near to each_other they will perhaps support each other
goodness me
what a_lot_of lego bricks
that's a little table isn't it
see if it'll go on like that
oh there we are
oh even higher
it's not as big as the other one though is it
oh you're going to have_to stand up shortly aren't you
to do it
come on
you've missed out the two on the end there
that's it
I've never seen such a large tower Aran
ever
a long time ago
where was it
was it one that Martin made
oh
I don't remember that
can you still reach
are you sure
it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
going to put some more bones on
that's fish
that's it isn't it
I think we'd better put some bricks behind that to support it like we did with the bones
there we are
and then you can put that one on top like that
oh let's just get it right
there we are
yes
it's getting a bit bigger isn't it
bigger all the time
well you could do but there are plenty of other bricks aren't there
well yes
have you got have you is the tower as tall as it  going to be
are you not going to make it any taller
well he would go on that one darling
you've got_to stand up to put him on
well be very very careful
you don't want your tower to fall over just as you've got it so nicely made do you
I'm not sure how he goes on
in fact whether he goes on at all
that's the video
it's all right
I don't know
that'll have_to do
well because Mummy can't get it on any other way can she
is that it for tower building now
a bit bigger
and a bit bigger
well are there any more bricks for this other tower
you know it's not coffee because Mummy didn't grind any coffee beans did she
oh this tower's made
it's bigger than the other
going right past the giraffe aren't we
are there any more bricks
oh
I think this is I think this tower's going to be as tall as you Aran
is it
can you find me any more bricks
thank_you
oh that other one's got left behind hasn't it
I don't think you can do that darling
it's going to fall over
shall we take the giraffe off
are there any other bricks for this tower
big ones
all right
I'll put the giraffe on if I can
I can't do it again
it's all right
I've managed now
I've managed
sort of
Aran
if you pick it up it's going to fall over honestly
it will
it'll fall over
it will
what are you going to do with it
are you going to put a monkey on the top
or are you going to put Pingu on the top
or are you going to have a little man on the top
there's monkey
monkey monkey monkey
ah the monkey
Dry_Bones
we went to see Dry_Bones at Christmas didn't we
Dry_Bones
he was looking for some bones
he was going to get the bones of the monkey
and the bones of the donkey
and the bones of the parrot
the parrot
the parrot the monkey and the donkey were all in the jungle weren't they
and there was that tiger wasn't there
and the tiger kept threatening them
but really he was quite a nice tiger
he didn't want to eat them did he
and they kept tricking him
every time he thought they were caught
every time he thought he'd caught them they got away again didn't they
and then there was that man called Dry_Bones wasn't there
who came out_of a hole in the ground
at Christmas
Christmas
don't you remember we went with Daddy
yes
and with me
it was a sort of Christmas pantomime wasn't it that we went to see
instead of going to the pantomime we went to see that
it was a magic story wasn't it about the jungle and about the animals
well he was just called tiger wasn't he
hmm
he was just like that wasn't he
a tiger
grr
no
willn't willn't willn't
be nice to him
there was a tunnel wasn't there in the ground that they all went down to hide
get away from Dry_Bones
you remember do you
there were lots there were lots_of children there weren't there
they'd all come from different schools
put you up
is this so you're taller than that tower there
you want to be the biggest do you
the monkey's going to jump down is he
I think he'll be pretty silly if he did
he'll more than hurt himself darling
oh dear
poor tiger
oh dear
he's hurt himself
shall we send for the circus train
take poor tiger away now he's hurt himself
oh Pingu as_well
goodness me
oh poor tiger
poor Pingu
oh and that pig's jumped as_well has he
that was remarkably silly
oh put Pingu there
let him have a lie down
put the piggy
oh not Jumbo the elephant
and a cow
they've all jumped off this tower
is that cow trying to jump over the moon
where's the little dog that laughs
hey diddle diddle
the cat and the fiddle
the cow jumped over the moon
the little dog laughed to see such sport
and the dish ran away with the spoon
you're the dish running away with the spoon are you
are you coming back to drink your orange juice
Aran
all these animals are waiting for you
well this giraffe wants to know how to get down off this tower
he's getting a bit frightened up there
because you see he's seven feet tall with his neck anyway
and then he's on top of that great big tower
and he's getting a bit dizzy
how's he going to get down
oh no
can't we do something nice for him
oh poor giraffe
he's another one that'll have_to go in in in the hospital train
oh you've kissed him better have you
well can't he go on the train instead
he'd much rather go on the train instead of going back on that great big tower
all right
got him on the train have you
what's the matter Aran
hmm
there's a very irritated keeper here
he wants to know who's who has caused his animals to climb these great big towers and jump off the top
he's going to be very very cross when he finds out who it is
what're you going to do Aran
hmm
oh he's broken his leg
and that's your answer to it is it
well we'd better put him on the hospital train then hadn't we
here we go
poor Mister_Keeper
he was only trying to do his job wasn't he
he was wasn't he
get down Aran
come on
you're supposed to be playing aren't you
come and play with me
the answers
that's a difficult one
what can't you see
the answers
well the answers aren't there darling
like when I tape something like Fireman_Sam for you on the television
and you watch it over and over and over again
come on
I think this car's Gumdrop
it's got some hens roosting in the back seat
there
do you think they're going to lay an egg
oh and who's this coming to bark at them
who is it
what's this dog called
well I think I think the hens  jump out if the dog jumped in
dogs like chasing hens don't they
remember like Horace liked chasing those hens
is that Dapple the horse
he doesn't like jumping
well that's so little boys can't put the bag on their head isn't it
oh
a sausage
well you've got_to find the sausage haven't you
come on
can you do these yet
which is the biggest one
measure them
come on
let's see
Aran
put them together
put them together and you tell me
you give me the biggest one
come on
you give me the biggest of those two hoops Aran
does it all fit through that hoop
what are you putting through that hoop
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
is it a bracelet then
or is it a water
an armband
which is the biggest of those two hoops
hmm
am I going to get a reply
it'd be a shame if you got stuck you know
oh
oh Aran
you've knocked your towers over just like that
why should I
you do it
no
and I don't either
oh is that a an ice that you're eating Aran
no
don't put it in your mouth please
come on
don't don't put it in our mouth
just pretend please
just pretend
come on
where's the rest of my tower Aran
hmm
is there any more
come on
don't put it in your mouth please
