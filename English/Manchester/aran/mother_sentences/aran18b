you've what
hidden them
where've you hidden them
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
look
here's that shark
that's what it did to that man didn't it
he was he was in the Indian ocean wasn't he
and he was on his surf board
and the shark came along through the great waves
mm
got his leg didn't it
and it wouldn't let go would it
wouldn't let go
it kept pulling
kept pulling didn't it
it wasn't satisfied with just a leg was it
it wanted to eat the whole of that man didn't it
and he kept pulling on the leg and the man kept pulling back didn't he
just like that it was wasn't it
just like that
what happened
did the shark did the shark eat the leg
it didn't
that's for where it fits on the lego
come on
oh look
this is where the shark fits
right
what're you going to build out_of this lego
hmm
I'll tell you what
that train can do all sorts of things
I tell you what
we're going to build some shark nets here so_that he shark doesn't come into land does it so it can't get men on their surf boards
take that man out
he can't drive the train
why not
is this the circus train
is it
the circus is coming to town
well all right
Bumbo can go on this side
perhaps we'll dispense with the shark
shall we have an enclosure for the animals while they're resting
before they have_to go into the circus
do you remember when we went to see the circus
hmm
Aran
do you remember seeing the elephant outside
he was moving bails of hay wasn't he
it's a long time ago though isn't it
there weren't any lions were there
or were there
I think there were actually weren't there
there were some camels weren't there
and some horses
you lost the motor cars did you
they're in the kitchen are they
some naughty boy's taken them into the kitchen
well that's terrible isn't it
not the sort of behavior we expect is it
is that going in the animal pen
no
well that one doesn't because that one isn't a lego animal
oh is that a sheep
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh all right then
are we going to have are we going to have a vegetarian tiger
that doesn't eat meat
it eats bananas
it's not
all right
that horsie's going in is it
right
is that on the circus train as_well
yes
it's stuck on
that one's not a lego one either so it doesn't quite go in the holes in the same way does it
come on
shall we bring it round here
choo
choochoo
right
it's yours is it
far be it from me to interfere
it's going to get its leg stuck in the hole is it
well if you do that the horse might break its leg mightn't it
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh
it's poorly
well shall we put this horse to lie down then
shall we make this the animal hospital
they were making an animal hospital on Blue_Peter yesterday weren't they
well that's the cow's udder
that's where the milk comes from
it's going in there is it
are you going to put its feet in the holes
doesn't that horse ever get to get off the train
has it got_to stay on has it
forever
is this a circus train or is it a runaway train
oh well if it's a runaway train it's going to go forever isn't it
whoo
all round everywhere
oh miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
pardon
it's hurt its leg
well is this one going to lie down as_well then
are you going to be the vet
are you going to come and mend these legs for them
what're you going to do
are you going to stroke them so_that they get better again
oh nice and gently Aran
nice and gently
are you going to give them some medicine so_that they feel better
that's some fish isn't it
perhaps you'd better slip some medicine in their food
put some in with their hay
what do you think
that's the medicine is it
is that the cow eating the medicine
oh
do you think its leg's strong enough for it to stand on now
oh well
shall we try
it's been poorly has it
oh is it limping
is its leg still sore
oh it's lying down in the train
is it still alive
Aran
is it
is that sheep still alive
or are they dead
they're dead are they
well where are we going to take them then
are we going to bury them
well where are you going to bury them
in this box
shall we make a little box out_of lego where you can bury them
somebody's been making something nice out_of this lego haven't they
look at that
that's smart isn't it
is this the box here where you're going to bury them
or shall we build a box out_of our bricks
that might be easier then we can put a lid on it can't we
you're making a what
a hospital
or a box
a box
right
are you putting animals in this box
our box has only got one side though
we need more sides than that for a box don't you
come on
let's make that one of the sides
there's a bit more
crash
all those chickens going in the box as_well
right
right well we've got chickens
we've got a cow
is this horse in the box
you want to take the horse do you
where are you taking the horse
are you taking it back to the enclosure where the animals are
oh it's parked has it
it's going in now is it
is this because its leg was so sore
are all the animals going in this box
there
well what is it then
the back door's just there is it
why don't you do a bit of building with this lego yourself
instead of leaving it all to me
oh you want to build it now
well you've just pulled it all to pieces
are you going to build it back up again
is there enough room in there
you've got some holes in your walls
are those for windows
oh what's that on top of the train
there you are
oh can't he stand up
so there's more room
is there room for the horse
or are you taking the horse
well you're going to have_to pile them up aren't you
I think they're just about all right are they
well it might go on
it might not
it might slide off
are these all bodys
are they all alive or are they dead this lot
well I think you could put the sheep in round here perhaps
because there's just a little bit more room isn't there
where are you taking them all
the hens have_to go in
well go on
put the hens down there
right
there you are
they're all in
all aboard
all aboard the circus train
where are they going
oh
you've had a crash
well wouldn't it be easier if perhaps we took this out
and there'd be more room wouldn't there
are you going to put the horse
right
right
I shalln't interfere
I shalln't interfere at all
there's a motor car
