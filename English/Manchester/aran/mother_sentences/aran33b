it relies on me picking eggs up in the first place doesn't it
I'm not sure I'm going to do it
not until my shop's ready
mhm

I shall write to the B_B_C and tell them they've got something to answer about
what have I told you about speaking properly
I've not found my eggs yet
the shop's in such a mess I can't find my eggs
goodness me
I've never known a shop like it for being in a mess
somebody has been in and tipped everything all over the floor
and I've got_to sort it out before I can do anything
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't

and the bread
and there's the freezer
pardon
what are you expecting me to do
what bit the dust
where've you picked that expression up from
hmm

let me have a look down that great big cavern
oh Aran
oh
glad that tongue's not mine
it's gone a funny color
what have you been eating
have you been eating black currants
oh that explains why your tongue's turned black then doesn't it
well you've got a very bad chest
haven't you
terrible cough
and a black tongue
what do you think you've got
is it the measles
I don't think so
I think it's plague
oh thank_you
are you going to sing Ring_a_ring_of_roses then
why not
that'll make you better
oh I'd rather not
it's terrible
look at your teeth
oh
I'm not putting my finger near your teeth
I might get bitten
they look like shark's teeth to me
you're going the right way to get a smack
that's very very naughty of you
isn't it
very naughty indeed
now come on
you go and play then
because Mummy's not pleased with you at all is she
no
no
I'm not going to do anything until you say you're sorry
well you don't seem very sorry to me
yes you did
you did it on purpose
your intention was to hurt wasn't it
yeah well
I'm not pleased with you at all
I shall play with all these things on my own
well then
you see you're going to hurt me again aren't you
well I'm not going to play with you until you say you're sorry properly
well you'd better come and kiss my finger better hadn't you
no
that's the wrong one
no
it's that little one
no
well I'm not going to be friends with you Aran until you come and put your arms round me and tell me properly that you're sorry
are you sorry
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
are you going to do it again
well I don't think you are very sorry at all
you're getting to be a very very silly little boy
that will do
come on
right
come on then
well you play nicely with these toys then
come on
let's build some lego bricks up
oh not again
right well get building
well I can't see anything
you'd better find Pingu first of all hadn't you
you're in a very silly mood aren't you Aran
it's no wonder Mummy doesn't want to play with you because you're so silly
isn't that the case
right
well all you're doing now is messing about isn't it
right
how are you going to make it
it doesn't look very big to me
well if you put all the bricks in the middle how is Pingu going to get inside
well Aran
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
he makes what go away
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
why not
a sausage
it was a hotdog
somebody took it out
did you
what did you do with it
did you eat it
was it tasty
very tasty
well you're the first person I know that says a plastic sausage is tasty
right
where's Pingu
well if you think you need a man on the roof yes
oh
that looks good doesn't it
please will you move your hand is what you say
right well we'll build a bit more of the roof then should we
this bit
well just be careful Aran or else it'll break
because it's not very strong
that's the front off the train so it's not likely to go on the roof is it
hmm
the barriers
there's Pingu
is Pingu going in
and his friend
who's his friend
there you are
that's Pinga
right
have you got another barrier to put over the front
well if you stood them both up you'd do a lot better wouldn't you
there'd be space for them both
well you find it
it's in there somewhere
you turned everything out didn't you
I can see one now
what do you need one at the back for
to stop everybody coming through the garden
what sort of people are you expecting
some baddies
and what are they going to do
what are they going to do to Pingu
what are they going to do to him
smash him
well there is another one isn't there
well there was
can you find it
right
well put it across there then
well that's not very well fixed is it
all right then
here you are
what're you doing now
putting some more on
right
there you are
it's making the roof stronger
you need a little one to go there don't you
or you could put that one on top there
that's right
that's a bit long Aran
it's going to fall
oh you've not got that right
this is a crazy roof isn't it
what a funny shape it is
are you putting some more on
is it going to have a tower on it
no
it's going to fall to bits
I think that little man's a bit in the way really isn't he
what is it
what's that
a bit on it
what sort of a bit
what do you mean
is that the church steeple
yes
it's very nice
it is a very funny igloo
igloos are usually round aren't they
and that's not round at all is it
where's it round
oh his friend Dobbin's come to visit him has he
is he going to give Dobbin some tea
grass
a plate of grass for tea
does Dobbin like that
do they
and hay
anything else
what
his friend the cow
what's the cow called
oh
what's he going to give Lynn to eat
oh a plate of hay
what's Pingu eating
what's he having
what does he like best
he likes fish does he
right
so he's going to be busy isn't he getting tea ready for three different people who want three different things
what for
she'll be cold
oh you are are you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
