so we can see them
yeah
yeah
what do we need to go with that one do you think

hmm
pardon
you don't know
we need some cake to go with it do you
is that cake

that one doesn't go with that one does it
what where do birds put their eggs
do you know
in a n
nest
can you see a nest
might not know what a nest looks like
there's a nest
that's it
where's the big nest
what
to go with the big egg

in the other game
what about this teddy
that's an easy one isn't it
that happened to your dolly this morning didn't it
what happened
her arm came out
didn't it
yeah
in the bath

I thought you might
oh
what's that one
that lives with the cup
that's a good idea
what
oh
there
oh
you see if it goes with that one
um that's not an egg cup
that's a teacup
you don't know what an egg cup is do you
we don't have boiled eggs

I'll perhaps find the other game in a minute that that one goes in
yeah
