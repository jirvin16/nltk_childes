it's missing
okay

www
oh
there's one there
oh
well
the other one's gone on his travels
oh no
here he is
thought he'd gone on his travels
gone on holiday
are they at the station
you know who else could go in this train don't you
your men could go couldn't they
mhm
hey

www
yes
hang on
two trains
okay
to go on the railway
oh

oh
going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going
pardon
you want me to push that one
this one's going behind the men's house
choo
oh
this one's going to London
okay
I think this is London over here
the trouble is we've forgotten to bring any people with us
no people got on the trains did they
I'm going
my train's going back to get some people
pardon
oh dear
oh
is it broken near London
oh
okay
I think it's because the engine's a bit big
there you are
okay
oh fiddlesticks
yeah
that might help
that'll work better now
let's see
going going going going going going going going
I think this red man's going in the back
um that red man's going inside
oh
you can have these ones
okay
I might have_to be a bit selective because that one's got a bit of a circle bit
there
how's that
yeah
but he's too tall
that's why I've chosen one of those little ones
well
that one's too tall as_well
choo
okay
going going going going going going going going going going
go on then
you wouldn't be following me would you
I've got_to London
oh
my people are getting off
your people aren't getting off
my people are
my train's going back over here
pardon
well
they're having a day out in London
they don't want to get on the train yet
the train'll come back for them later
I should think
we don't want to come on the train
oh
well
in a minute
I'm just drinking my tea
I know you are
what's happened
is there
where from
oh
oh
oh
whoops

what's the matter
is it because that bit's
oh
will that work
no
there we are
okay
okay
oh
that's a good idea
onto the train
under the tunnel
it's going under the tunnel Anne
under the table
okay
yes
does this train need to go and park under there as_well then
does it right
oh right
shows you how to do lots_of different things doesn't it
mhm
mhm
yeah
okay
which one would you like to try and do
shall we do this funny duck
that bridge
that's the zoo isn't it
so
we need the green board don't we
and then
oh
that's right
okay
shall we do the bridge first
that bridge is all made with red bricks isn't it
well
one yellow brick on the top
there's one yellow brick
yes
the park one
did you
oh
it does look like an aeroplane
yeah
I think there's some fences across the middle
Caroline's fences are red look
and the ones on there are blue
but that doesn't matter
oh yes
you're right
perhaps
oh
and there's some blue ones in there
I don't think there's another blue one
www
one more red one
www
oh
okay
um can I arrange your red bricks or have I got_to leave those ones like that
okay
right
going going going going going going going going going going going
okay
well
I don't need green ones do I I don't think for this
we need the tigers
we do need the tigers
okay
it's something like that Anne
yeah
okay
that little yellow um little small tiger is sitting there look
steps
hang on
hang on
hang on
hang on
how's that
four steps
oh
okay
nobody
perhaps it was that big tiger
that's very good
now
the other side look
we need some yellow bricks
they're yellow bricks
yeah
no
I don't think so
can I move your aeroplane
oh
I think you've probably got enough yellow ones there
oh
because the yellow ones go like this look
yellow one goes like this
and then like this
and then we need
or will we need
and elephant on one side and a hippo on the other side
okay
that's lovely
can you find the hippo and the elephant
that's right
one on one side and one on the other
because I think they're in two different fields
can you get it on
okay
I see
so he can climb up
lots_of yellow in the farm
in the zoo now isn't there
whoops
it's lovely
yes
right
over here Anne
I think what we'd better have is
we'd better find some white bricks so_that we can put the penguins on the white bricks
the white bricks are a bit like snow aren't they
or ice
and that's what penguins like
they like it when it's cold
just over here
that's it
little bricks and the big bricks
that's lovely
shall I look for the penguins
think they might like them piled up a bit
might they like them a little bit piled
that's it
with some blue bricks as_well for the water
okay
there
oh
that's beautiful
shall I put the penguins on this bit then
one at the top
going going going going going going going
oh
they like their house don't they
now
shall we build a tree for the monkey to sit in
what color bricks do we need for that
okay
could use these ones as_well
pardon
have a colored tree
it keeps falling
are you cross with it
here
let's make give it a firm base
that might be a bit better
he just stands up doesn't he
right
that's his tree
you know what
the men that are in the train could come to the zoo now to look at the animals couldn't they
okay
think the whales would go in with the tigers
or do you think they'd go in with the penguins
okay
oh yes
shall I bring
going going going going going going going going going
okay
okay
let's get the zoo all ready and then you can take you can open the doors
you can unlock it and say it's open
can't you
when the zoo's all ready
okay
www

www
www
oh
going going going going going going going
how's that
the trouble is the taller you make it the more likely it is to fall over really
okay
going going going going going going going going
going going going going going going going
okay
he has hasn't he
it's because he's not tall enough
so he's sticking out the window
he's got his head out the window so he can see what's going on
here comes the train
can the people get off
is the zoo open
okay
going going going going going going going going going going
going going going going going going going going
he's in the other driver now is he
whoops
going going going going going going going going going
oh
going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going going

I would wake them up
because they might not want to miss out on the zoo
oh
they've gone to see the animals

he's a big tower
and the horse
oh no

oh
what's he doing on the top of that tower
he's an animal
he's in the play area I think
he's an animal
if he's not careful the hippo'll eat him
come out
