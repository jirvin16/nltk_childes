is
that
cake
no
that
is
an
egg
is
that
cake
no
what

that
a

is
that

think
you

do
not
you
to
put
it
together
that
is
it
which
one
shall
we
do
next
the
egg
okay
oh
the
little
eggs
alright
then
whoops
what
do
you
think
the
little
eggs
go
with
they
might
do
you
can
try
that
I
think
that
one
might
be
in
the
wrong
box
Anne
yeah
that
one's
in
the
wrong
box
that
one
does
not
go
with
that
one
does
it
what
where
do
birds
put
their
eggs
do
you
know
in
a
n
nest
can
you
see
a
nest
might
not
know
what
a
nest
looks
like
there
is
a
nest
that
is
it
where
is
the
big
nest
what
to
go
with
the
big
egg
well
that
big
egg
goes
in
another
game
and
I
think
it
probably
goes
with
an
egg
cup
in
the
other
game
what
about
this
teddy
that
is
an
easy
one
is
not
it
that
happened
to
your
dolly
this
morning
did
not
it
what
happened
her
arm
came
out
did
not
it
yeah
in
the
bath
now
what
do
you
think
goes
in
that
box
that
is
right
that
puppet
it
is
called
a
Jack_in_the_box
not
Anne_in_the_box
Jack_in_the_box
John_Collins
is
that
what
you
are
thinking
of
I
thought
you
might
oh
what
is
that
one
that
lives
with
the
cup
that
is
a
good
idea
what
oh
there
oh
you
see
if
it
goes
with
that
one
um
that
is
not
an
egg
cup
that
is
a
teacup
you
do
not
know
what
an
egg
cup
is
do
you
we
do
not
have
boiled
eggs
I
should
leave
that
one
out
the
way
because
I
do
not
think
I
will
perhaps
find
the
other
game
in
a
minute
that
that
one
goes
in
yeah
you
were
doing
the
teapot
one
were
not
you
what
is
that
teapot
lost
oh
that
is
right
needs
a
lid
what
have
you
lost
it
is
here
it
needs
a
saucer
that
is
another
one
that
is
a
bit
out_of
date
here
or
a
plate
it
is
a
bit
like
a
plate
oh
what
do
you
think
you
need
to
go
with
that
and
what
is
that
the
toothpaste
that
is
right
think
somebody's
squeezed
that
toothpaste
have
not
they
oh
no
I
do
not
think
that
you
did
you
need
a
lock
to
go
with
the
key
www
that
oh
now
that
goes
that
is
a
bow
and
that
goes
with
the
violin
I
think
oh
cannot
see
a
violin
that
is
a
hard
one
www
oh
here
it
is
that
is
a
hard
one
is
not
it
