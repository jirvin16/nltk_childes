this
time
in

happened
he
has
got
his

on
in
the

that
is
a
funny
place
to
have
your
hat
on
is
not
it
and
what
is
happened
he
said
boo
what
is
happened
to
all
the
water

much
that
the
water's
splashed
out
all
over
the
floor
what
will
he
have_to

do
you
think

was
doing
with
this
book
in
the
bath
that
is
a
funny
place
to
read
a
book
is
not
it
do
you
read
books
in
the
bath
where
do
you
read
books
yeah
so
what
is
happening
there
do
you
think
yeah

think
that
is
more
likely
actually
I
think
Preston's
running
away

his
dad's
chasing
him
going
going
going
going
going

going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
do
not
you

keeps
scaring
everybody
yeah
mhm
I
think
so
do
not
know
mhm
do
you
think
it
is
daytime
or
nighttime
why
do
think
it
is
nighttime
pardon
because
it
