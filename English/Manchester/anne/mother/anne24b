is
supposed
to
go
over
the
top
of
that
blouse
think
she
is
going
to
look
a
bit
bundled
up
hmm
supposed
to

small
for
your

do
not
you
you
have
not
really
got
a
smaller
baby
Lucy's
the
smallest
one
you

I
can
think
of

that
one
we
could
see
oh
hang
on
hang
on
is
it
the
wrong
way
round
it
is
because
her
head
turns
round
Anne

peculiar
dolly

you
or
for
dolly
for
the
dollys

going
going
going
going

think
yours
ought_to

will
get
a
cold
head
there
that
is
