okay
oh
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
pardon
you
want
me
to
push
that
one
this
one's
going
behind
the
men's
house
choo
oh
this
one's
going
to
London
okay
I
think
this
is
London
over
here
the
trouble
is
we
have
forgotten
to
bring
any
people
with
us
no
people
got
on
the
trains
did
they
I
am
going
my
train's
going
back
to
get
some
people
pardon
oh
dear
oh
is
it
broken
near
London
oh
okay
I
think
it
is
because
the
engine's
a
bit
big
there
you
are
okay
oh
fiddlesticks
yeah
that
might
help
that'll
work
better
now
let
us
see
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
I
think
this
red
man's
going
in
the
back
um
that
red
man's
going
inside
oh
you
can
have
these
ones
okay
I
might
have_to
be
a
bit
selective
because
that
one's
got
a
bit
of
a
circle
bit
there
how
is
that
yeah
but
he
is
too
tall
that
is
why
I
have
chosen
one
of
those
little
ones
well
that
one's
too
tall
as_well
choo
okay
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
go
on
then
you
would
not
be
following
me
would
you
I
have
got_to
London
oh
my
people
are
getting
off
your
people
be
not
getting
off
my
people
are
my
train's
going
back
over
here
pardon
well
they
are
having
a
day
out
in
London
they
do
not
want
to
get
on
the
train
yet
the
train'll
come
back
for
them
later
I
should
think
we
do
not
want
to
come
on
the
train
oh
well
in
a
minute
I
am
just
drinking
my
tea
I
know
you
are
what
is
happened
is
there
where
from
oh
oh
oh
whoops
what
is
the
matter
is
it
because
that
bit's
oh
will
that
work
no
there
we
are
okay
okay
oh
that
is
a
good
idea
onto
the
train
under
the
tunnel
it
is
going
under
the
tunnel
Anne
under
the
table
okay
yes
does
this
train
need
to
go
and
park
under
there
as_well
then
does
it
right
oh
right
shows
you
how
to
do
lots_of
different
things
does
not
it
mhm
mhm
yeah
okay
which
one
would
you
like
to
try
and
do
shall
we
do
this
funny
duck
that
bridge
that
is
the
zoo
is
not
it
so
we
need
the
green
board
do
not
we
and
then
oh
that
is
right
okay
shall
we
do
the
bridge
first
that
bridge
is
all
made
with
red
bricks
is
not
it
well
one
yellow
brick
on
the
top
there
is
one
yellow
brick
yes
the
park
one
did
you
oh
it
does
look
like
an
aeroplane
yeah
I
think
there
is
some
fences
across
the
middle
Caroline's
fences
are
red
look
and
the
ones
on
there
are
blue
but
that
does
not
matter
oh
yes
you
are
right
perhaps
oh
and
there
is
some
blue
ones
in
there
I
do
not
think
there
is
another
blue
one
www
one
more
red
one
www
oh
okay
um
can
I
arrange
your
red
bricks
or
have
I
got_to
leave
those
ones
like
that
okay
right
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
okay
well
I
do
not
need
green
ones
do
I
I
do
not
think
for
this
we
need
the
tigers
we
do
need
the
tigers
okay
it
is
something
like
that
Anne
yeah
okay
that
little
yellow
um
little
small
tiger
is
sitting
there
look
steps
hang
on
hang
on
hang
on
hang
on
how
is
that
four
steps
oh
okay
nobody
perhaps
it
was
that
big
tiger
that
is
very
good
now
the
other
side
look
we
need
some
yellow
bricks
they
are
yellow
bricks
yeah
no
I
do
not
think
so
can
I
move
your
aeroplane
oh
I
think
you
have
probably
got
enough
yellow
ones
there
oh
because
the
yellow
ones
go
like
this
look
yellow
one
goes
like
this
and
then
like
this
and
then
we
need
or
will
we
need
and
elephant
on
one
side
and
a
hippo
on
the
other
side
okay
that
is
lovely
can
you
find
the
hippo
and
the
elephant
that
is
right
one
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other
because
I
think
they
are
in
two
different
fields
can
you
get
it
on
okay
I
see
so
he
can
climb
up
lots_of
yellow
in
the
farm
in
the
zoo
now
is
not
there
whoops
it
is
lovely
yes
right
over
here
Anne
I
think
what
we
would
better
have
is
we
would
better
find
some
white
bricks
so_that
we
can
put
the
penguins
on
the
white
bricks
the
white
bricks
are
a
bit
like
snow
be
not
they
or
ice
and
that
is
what
penguins
like
they
like
it
when
it
is
cold
just
over
here
that
is
it
little
bricks
and
the
big
bricks
that
is
lovely
shall
I
look
for
the
penguins
think
they
might
like
them
piled
up
a
bit
might
they
like
them
a
little
bit
piled
that
is
it
with
some
blue
bricks
as_well
for
the
water
okay
there
oh
that
is
beautiful
shall
I
put
the
penguins
on
this
bit
then
one
at
the
top
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
oh
they
like
their
house
do
not
they
now
shall
we
build
a
tree
for
the
monkey
to
sit
in
what
color
bricks
do
we
need
for
that
okay
could
use
these
ones
as_well
pardon
have
a
colored
tree
it
keeps
falling
are
you
cross
with
it
here
let
us
make
give
it
a
firm
base
that
might
be
a
bit
better
he
just
stands
up
does
not
he
right
that
is
his
tree
you
know
what
the
men
that
are
in
the
train
could
come
to
the
zoo
now
to
look
at
the
animals
could
not
they
okay
think
the
whales
would
go
in
with
the
tigers
or
do
you
think
they
would
go
in
with
the
penguins
okay
oh
yes
shall
I
bring
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
okay
okay
let
us
get
the
zoo
all
ready
and
then
you
can
take
you
can
open
the
doors
you
can
unlock
it
and
say
it
is
open
cannot
you
when
the
zoo's
all
ready
okay
www
www
www
oh
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
how
is
that
the
trouble
is
the
taller
you
make
it
the
more
likely
it
is
to
fall
over
really
okay
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
okay
he
has
has
not
he
it
is
because
he
is
not
tall
enough
so
he
is
sticking
out
the
window
he
is
got
his
head
out
the
window
so
he

going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
are
they
going
going
going
going
going
going
I
would
wake
them

out
on
the
zoo
oh
they
have
gone
to
see
the
