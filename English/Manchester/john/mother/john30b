Baby_small
the
red
one
what

mhm
good

starting
mhm
very
good

a
station
for
your
train
what
are
you

think
Granddad's
going

make
you
a
farm
sometime
oh
good
mhm
that
is
a
very
small
farm
today
John
they
cannot
no
there
is
no
door
how
are
they
going
to
get
in
a
now
you
just
need
some
animals
mhm
perhaps
he
does
yeah
mhm
a
very
good
farm
now
when
was
that
then
the
bull
in
the
farm
did
we
I
do
not
remember
seeing
a
bull
a
yes
you
did
we
always
go
in
the
coffee
shop
because
Mummy
likes
it
I
think
so
maybe
he
is
too
big
no
you
are
right
it
is
good
to
try
these
things
is
not
it
okay
very
good
yes
that
is
a
much
better
fit
what
must
go
in
the
carwash
this
red
car
Daddy's
car
must
have
a
wash
as_well
very
dirty
is
not
it
mhm
yes
it
has
I
think
our
neighbors
have
got
a
better
idea
have
not
they
they
have
just
replaced
both
of
their
cars
saves
taking
them
to
the
carwash
shiny
new
ones
where
is
the
carwash
perhaps
you
can
make
a
carwash
for
them
find
a
good
place
are
you
a
big
snake
there
is
a
long
white
snake
is
not
there
in
the
garden
centre
did
you
see
that
the
albino
snake
yes
that
is
a
horse
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
I
suppose
the
same
way
that
they
got
up
are
they
jumping
we
could
make
a
ladder
make
a
ladder
for
them
to
get
down
have_to
make
it
pretty
tall
though
would
not
we
how
tall
do
we
have_to
make
this
oh
that'll
do
there
we
go
maybe
a
bit
taller
whoops
it
is
very
long
is
not
it
that
is
why
it
is
breaking
oh
what
is
happened
to
this
staircase
oh
I
see
shall
I
modify
it
a
bit
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
oh
it
is
not
structurally
very
sound
this
one
