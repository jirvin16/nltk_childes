we
have
not

a
look
at
this
John
do
you
want
to
have
a
look
at
this
magazine
it
is
about
a
happy
dragon
do
you
want

read
it

actually
he
is
happy
it
says
he
is
happy
and
he
is
smiling
he
is
a
he
is
a
good
dragon
I
think
there
might
be
somebody
who
is
angry
but
the
dragon
is
happy
what
can
you
see
here
what
can
you
see
cockerel
mhm
there
is
a
what
shape
is
on
the
end
of
the
spoon
can
you
see
the
shape
what
shape
is
that
yeah
they
are

love
spoons

wonder
what
is
happened
there
I
think

I
think
that

what
is
happened
when
he

puts
out
smoke
from
his
nose
look
look
at
the
steam
