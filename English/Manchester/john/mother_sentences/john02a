oh it's a big wheel that one
very big wheel
mhm
soil
soil in the dumper truck
oh look at this dumper truck
it's full of elephants

oh very dirty this one
very dirty truck
he's muddy
he's a muddy truck
what's it got in its arm here
mhm a big stone

I think it's more like a bulldozer
let's find where the roller is
where's the roller
it's not there is it
where is the roller
maybe it's on the last page
ahhah
here he is
yeah steering wheel
and a mirror for the driver
so he can see behind him
and what are these
yeah wind wipers
swish swish swish
the wipers on the lorry go swish swish swish
all day
good
this is a funny picture
look there are fishies
inside the wheel
that's a bit strange
what can you see there

mhm
two fishies
one fish
two fish
fishies
two fish
mhm

and here's another roller
one two
it is yellow roller
there's two rollers on this page
there's a green roller and a yellow roller
two rollers
wow
that's a big one
yeah wow
it's quite complicated that one isn't it
what's it doing
it's building a road
it's making a road
he's moving all that soil
to make way for the paver
and then this one will press it all down flat
then another truck will come along with the tarmac
forklift
up down
what
let me have this bottle
let me have this bottle
oh look
there's a man running
he's running with a bucket
and the bucket's full of water
look he's spilling the bucket
water's coming out_of the bucket
but if there a truck held some water in his bucket it wouldn't spill
look at this big boulder
that must be very heavy
yeah a big piece of stone
what can we see on this page
this one's a very new digger
look it's not dirty
it's very clean
and bright yellow
you don't often see them like that
not those in the park anyway
they're very dirty aren't they now
there's the bulldozer
the bucket
no no no
it looks a bit like a a roller but it's a bulldozer
because the the steamroller has um big wheels
this one has caterpillar tracks
it's different
and this is called a mass excavator apparently
yes let's call it a digger
dirty
it's very dirty
it's been doing lots_of work
look at his big arm
it looks like teeth
he uses this for scooping up earth
and this is where the men sit to work
yeah a bolt
