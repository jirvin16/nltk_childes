all this glitter
it's very similar to your very first toothbrush in fact
that was a yellow sparkly one
yes
well we'll do that upstairs in the bath
but you're right

don't clean the floor with it
going going going going going going going going

do you remember how the dentist showed you to clean your teeth
how do you clean your teeth
whoops steady
you have_to brush them up and down
and the side teeth
and the top teeth
and the bottom teeth
and Mummy or Daddy must check them after you've done it
did you like the dentist John
was he a nice man
because you went with Daddy didn't you
yeah
just Daddy and John
shall we put it away because it's not for cleaning carpets
oh it looks like a caterpillar doesn't it
is it the caterpillar
his tail
a wiggly caterpillar
oh
I see
you're cleaning his teeth
yeah
