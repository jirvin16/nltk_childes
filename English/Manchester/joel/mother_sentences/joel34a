aren't you in the mood for reading
that's not melting
that's how it's dried

Joel
I'm getting a bit cross now
www

do something properly
instead of you ranting on about something nobody knows what you're on about
hey

you might have_to do this
that's probably all the television repair does
mhm
www
that's what it's for
is it mended yet
what's the matter with it
it's lost it's leads
little hole
oh
you ram them in and you can't get them out again
oh
it'll sound good on the tape
should that do the trick
what happened to the end of your screwdriver
you seem to have lost it
bet it's gone down the back of the tellie
yeah
I know that should do
but there's another one somewhere isn't there
oh
exercises
oh
is that what they do is it
is that how they keep fit
it's taking a long time to mend this television
it must be really badly broken
oh dear
is it mended yet
oh
what're we going to do
oh
just like that
and um where would we get a new one from
yeah
well
where would we get a new television from
oh
and do you think they might cost a_lot_of money
what
do you want your saw
everything is stuck isn't it
think your dad put these away because I can't get them out again
well
yes
I think you'd better else there'll be no videos for you if the television doesn't work

thirteen sixty eight
thirteen sixty eight
must write it down before I forget
yes
he just wanted to tell us how much we've got_to leave a cheque for

because
it's supposed to be able to saw on here and then it chops the wood but can't
apparently
I think you have_to do it across there
hang on a minute
let me
I think
definitely
oh
oh
well
that wasn't very good was it
didn't think it did it that easily
Joel
oh
or is it in
oh
I don't know
too complicated for me these children's toys
I think it's supposed to be in that bit there but
I'm not quite sure how you do it
Daddy'll know
mhm
let's just hope it works now
yeah
well
it does do that
but it's not supposed to do that
oh

what's the matter
oh
go away if you're going to make horrible noises
err
err
oh
I can't understand you when you talk like that
is it level
that's a spirit I think
what've you done with your other one
that's
going going going going going going going going going going

is it level
hmm
it's not level is it look

we've got a wonky video cabinet
oh
don't go all baby
you keep doing that and it's driving me up the wall
www
there it is

we seem to be missing one
going going going going going going
we can't find it
where's it gone
what did you do with it
Jim_bob
yeah
but there was another one
and it's gone
well
you did
because you went away and you didn't come back with it
yes
well
oh
you don't
oh
oh
look at that what you pulled off the wall
delightful

it's right down the back of the tellie
I can't get that until your Dad gets
and that'll probably be midnight because he's gone to Devon
it has
yes
well done

so we willn't be able to get it now until the morning probably
he will

probably
the Wombles
oh yeah
not that we're watching it
I'm just saying

because they used to be
once
a long time ago

Daddy was little once
remember on Sunday
when we were looking at all the photographs
and they were some pictures of Daddy when he was little weren't they
Mummy

one day you'll be old
like Mummy and Daddy
and what did you say
you told a funny didn't you
you didn't realize it
when Mama_Doris said and there's a picture of Uncle_Tony when he had chicken and what did you say
no
you didn't
you said I don't like chicken
I like Yorkshire pudding
so that's a good job then isn't it
you like chicken pie
that's right
chicken isn't something you eat
chicken makes you poorly sometimes
can you remember when Lucy had it
she got all those spots all over her face
but you've not had it yet so we don't know
can't understand how you've missed everything up until now
