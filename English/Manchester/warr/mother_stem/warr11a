I
have
get
Henry
s
oh

to
do
to
him

need
to
check
his
wheel
still
move
we
need
to
check
they
still
do
this
and
that
we
need
to
check
the
magnet
still
work
yes
is
this
be
this
engine
all
right
can
you
check

track
you
want
them
on
the
floor

the
dig
to
do
where's
where
be
the
dig
go
to
put
them
down
where
no
that
be
all
there
be
I
think
I
think
Henry
s
such
a
important
engine
he
real
ought_to
go
in
by
himself
maybe
not
be
he
go
in
with
that
other
locomotive
now
where
be
these
go
be
they
go
to
be
dump
on
the
cushion
to
be
put
on
the
cushion
move
that
tender
out_of
the
way
brumm
I
think
that
be
the
last
one
there
must
be
some
more
carriage
somewhere
but
I
do
not
know
where
they
be
you

that
be
too
big

most
of

real
Warren

like
this
can
be
scoop
or
this
whoops
Warren
just
move
your
finger

then
I
think
the
idea
Warren
be
to
pick
them
up
in
that
shovel
real
well
if
you
scoop
right
scoop
that
blue
car
in
and
then
we
lift
