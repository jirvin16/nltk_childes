even
the

does
not
normally
stand
on
tracks
does
he
oh
no
shall
we
have_to
get
the
crane
shall
we
go
and
get
the
crane
to
lift
Henry
up
back
on
well
you
just
wait
there
while
I
get
the
crane
from
out
here
here
it
is
what
has
your
what
have
your
Grandparents
done
to
this
crane
or
what
did
you
do
to
it
well
I
have
never
seen
this
bit
coming
out_of
here
before
right
let
us
pick
Henry
up
shall
we
shall
we
let
down
the
hook
help
to
pick
him
up
pick
up
his
tender
first
okay
pick
up
his
tender
put
it
back
on
oh
it
is
just
rolled
backwards
never
mind
let
us
pick
up
Henry
put
him
on
and
he
can
go
back
slowly
and
collect
his
tender
it
is
handy
having
a
crane
is
not
it
Warren
hooray
but
look
there
is
a
rhino
on
the
line
what
shall
we
do
shall
we
lift
the
rhino
off
with
the
crane
plonk
I
said
before
it
is
handy
oh
no
that
rhino's
back
on
again
how
can
we
get
him
off
okay
you
get
him
off
oh
no
the
rhino's
back
on
again
what
shall
we
do
pick
him
up
with
the
crane
well
I
think
the
crane's
quite
a
good
idea
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
car
oh
I
do
not
know
if
that
is
big
enough
to
move
a
rhino
pet
no
that
is
too
little
really
well
shall
we
move
this
rhino
it
is
is
not
it
no
we
do
not
want
him
going
too
fast
do
we
well
I
did
not
know
that
trains
could
go
on
roads
I
thought
they
needed
tracks
to
work
properly
had
you
better
move
that
vehicle
off
the
track
is
the
crane
going
to
get
rid
of
the
vehicle
oh
I
thought
you
would
I
was
hoping
you
would
see
that
never
mind
I
did
not
hide
it
well
enough
well
I
think
the
first
thing
you
need
to
do
is
get
rid
of
that
vehicle
off
the
track
it
is
very
dangerous
having
vehicles
that
is
better
it
is
very
dangerous
having
vehicles
on
train
tracks
is
not
it
shall
we
find
some
more
animals
to
go
in
the
middle
shall
we
find
some
more
animals
look
what
I
have
found
a
seal
and
a
panda
and
a
polar
bear
you
can
have
this
weebley
genie
oh
he
does
not
weebley
very
well
no
we
do
not
kick
them
well
one's
a
panda
and
one's
a
polar
bear
I
know
they
look
virtually
identical
the
white
one
is
a
polar
bear
and
the
black
and
white
one
is
a
panda
that
is
right
and
what
is
the
other
one
a
polar
bear
that
is
it
because
it
lives
in
polar
regions
north
pole
in
fact
no
polar
regions
not
pigeons
just
realized
Warren
this
weebley
genie
is
a
Disney
genie
oh
you
would
better
move
those
bears
poop
oh
better
had
you
would
better
move
find
some
way
of
getting
rid
of
those
bears
how
shall
we
move
them
but
how
are
we
going
to
move
the
bears
do
not
run
over
that
rhino
could
cause
damage
to
the
vehicle
yeah
thank_you
what
shall
I
do
with
him
now
I
think
a
snoring
teddy
might
wake
him
up
I
think
a
quiet
turkey
might
wake
him
up
I
think
a
roaring
lion
there
he
is
there
you
go
yeah
that
is
it
brilliant
he
has
and
he
is
got
a
very
funny
face
that
little
horn
on
the
end
of
his
nose
it
is
and
he
is
got
a
bit
of
a
grumpy
mouth
do
you
know
anybody
that
looks
like
this
Warren
that
is
a
relief
oh
be
careful
of
those
bears
those
poor
bears
I
know
what
we
can
do
we
can
send
someone
in
to
rescue
them
I
think
he
will
only
fit
on
there
backwards
that
way
round
well
it
does
not
really
fit
on
at
all
oh
it
does
maybe
he
does
whoops
I
have
lost
a
truck
good
job
Henry's
at
the
back
pushing
good
job
those
bears
are
off
the
track
are
they
a
that
is
nice
are
they
friends
oh
does
not
the
polar
bear
like
being
kissed
oh
right
green
go
for
the
train
there
is
is
not
there
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
shall
the
gorilla
come
and
move
the
wall
what
noise
does
a
gorilla
make
well
kind
of
I
am
not
sure
actually
what
come
and
watch
the
gorilla
taking
the
wall
down
big
strong
hand
oh
whoops
there
it
is
is
not
he
a
kind
gorilla
now
he
is
standing
on
the
track
in
the
way
oh
you
want
the
wall
okay
it
is
your
wall
and
your
tunnel
you
can
do
with
it
what
you
like
poor
Mummy
that
is
because
you
blew
all
the
air
out
you
sat
on
me
hard
well
the
driver
had
better
drive
very
carefully
then
had
not
he
oh
he
is
fallen
off
I
am
not
sure
you
should
go
on
fast
roads
when
your
polar
bear

not
attached
properly
that
is
better
is
not
it
oh
yes
I
do
not
think
the
gorilla's
even
seen
the
car
has
he
he
is
got
his
back
to
it
going
going
going
going
going
going
oh
what
a
surprise
now
what
is
the
gorilla
going
to
do
okay
he
is
saying
oy
who
bumped
my
bottom
I
think
a
level
crossing
might
be
a
good
idea
for
this
you
could
buy
one
with
your
pocket
money
could
not
you
so
cars
can
drive
over
more
easily
is
it
the
end
of
the
journey
it
is
he
is
going
to
come
and
look
in
the
tunnel
can
you
see
him
you
come
round
here
and
see
if
you
can
see
the
polar
bear
peeping
over
come
round
this
end
can
you
see
him
peeping
peekaboo
peekaboo
peekaboo
peekaboo
he
is
standing
on
top
of
the
wall
now
he
is
a
very
fit
polar
bear
is
not
he
he
can
do
a_lot_of
climbing
oh
jumped
onto
Henry's
tender
I
think
he
might
fall
when
we
go
over
the
bridge
oh
poor
bear
no
I
think
that
is
a
safer
way
for
him
to
travel
do
not
you
not
very
safe
on
the
back
of
a
train
what
kind
of
a
way
to
travel
is
that
yes
what
number
is
Henry
no
what
number
count
Mummy's
fingers
and
that
is
the
number
that
Henry
is
that
is
it
Henry's
number
three
and
that
number
on
his
tender
says
three
what
on
earth
is
that
Warren
what
is
that
noise
oh
right
oh
it
is
the
car
engine
reversing
that
is
what
you
call
going
backwards
in
a
car

not

reversing
where
