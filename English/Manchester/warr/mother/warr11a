though
this
morning
could
we
I
have
got
a
bumpy
track
here
with
the
trains
on
we
have
got
three
locomotives
because
it
is
such
a
long
train
the
fire
does
not
really
go
on
the
track
Warren
the
fire
could
go
along
the
side
like
Bertie_the_Bus
does
poor
Henry
is
he
happy
oh
yes
they
should
give
you
little
swapable
faces
should
not
they
so
we
can
put
a
sad
one
on
yes
it
is
stuck
on
all
those
wheels
pardon
no
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
how
many
wheels
are
there
yes
they
are
going
round
and
round
be
not
they
oh
no
Henry's
tender's
gone
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
if
he
is
not
got
any
coal
to
put
in
his
er
firebox
yeah
you
put
coal
in
the
firebox
to
heat
the
water
to
make
the
engine
go
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
because
engines
eat
coal
do
not
they
what
do
they
drink
what
do
engines
drink
yeah
Henry
has_to
have
special
coal
does
not
he
no
your
cup's
got
milk
in
and
you
have
just
told
me
that
engines
only
drink
water
engines
would
not
work
if
you
gave
them
milk
to
drink
there
would
be
a
horrible
smell
and
they
would
not
work
I
do
not
think
you
might
be
able
to
fit
a
little
car
on
that
one
shall
we
see
if
we
can
find
a
little
car
there
is
a
little
truck
I
think
oh
no
it
falls
off
it
is
better
on
that
one
because
that
one's
flat
at
the
top
is
not
it
see
how
that
one's
flat
that
one's
curved
that
one's
not
flat
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
I
think
that
is
probably
a
bit
big
no
the
big

definitely
too
big
I
am
not
sure
if
Henry
is
strong
enough
oh
yes
he
is
strong
enough
to
pull
it
yeah
that
breakdown
truck
goes
on
best
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
I
tell
you
what
we
probably
could
do
we
will
put
that
one
on
Henry's
tender
because
that
is
flat
and
we
could
put
this
one
on
there
but
I
do
not
know
if
Henry'sstrong
enough
to
pull
them
both
try
it
see
if
Henry
is
strong
enough
to
pull
them
oh
if
you
go
very
slow
oh
dear
oh
no
what
is
happened
what
happened
oh
no
oh
no
the
little
one
stays
on
best
does
not
it
except
you
are
driving
into
a
cushion
quick
the
fire
better
come
brumm
it
is
crashed
into
the
track
quick
over
we
go
the
fire
can
rescue
Henry
in
fact
what
we
need
it
has
and
to
clean
up
the
mess
we
have
got
the
digger
and
we
are
going
to
get
every
get
everything
in
the
digger
whoops
I
am
not
a
very
good
digger
driver
am
I
and
we
will
drive
over
to
shall
we
take
them
to
Crewe
to
mend
them
here
we
are
at
Crewe
there
we
can
mend
those
engines
I
will
go
back
and
get
some
more
to
mend
can
you
mend
those
while
I
am
getting
the
others
I
think
Henry'll
have_to
come
last
you
mend
those
other
carriages
and
trucks
I
have
got
Henry's
oh
okay
here
we
are
let
us
get
them
mended
poor
Henry
what
do
we
need
to
do
to
him
we
need
to
check
his
wheels
still
move
we
need
to
check
they
still
do
this
and
that
we
need
to
check
the
magnets
still
work
yes
is
this
is
this
engine
all
right
can
you
check
these
over
check
they
are
working
properly
I
think
they
are
hooray
they
are
working
again
shall
we
put
them
back
on
the
track
you
want
them
on
the
floor
okay
brumm
what
do
you
want
the
digger
to
do
where
is
where
is
the
digger
going
to
put
them
down
where
no
that
is
all
there
are
I
think
I
think
Henry's
such
an
important
engine
he
really
ought_to
go
in
by
himself
maybe
not
is
he
going
in
with
that
other
locomotive
now
where
are
these
going
are
they
going
to
be
dumped
on
the
cushion
to
be
put
on
the
cushion
move
that
tender
out_of
the
way
brumm
I
think
that
is
the
last
one
there
must
be
some
more
carriages
somewhere
but
I
do
not
know
where
they
are
you
want
to
pick
up
oh
crikey
I
have
started
something
here
have
not
I
Warren
now
some
of
these
are
too
big
that
is
too
big
and
that
is
too
big
and
that
is
too
big
most
of
these
vehicles
are
too
big
really
Warren
to
be
scooped
up
only
little
ones
like
this
can
be
scooped
or
this
whoops
Warren
just
move
your
fingers
right
you
do
some
scooping
now
then
I
think
the
idea
Warren
is
to
pick
them
up
in
that
shovel
really
well
if
you
scoop
right
scoop
that
blue
car
in
and
then
we
lift
this
lever
up
here
that
is
it
right
to
put
it
down
you
have_to
use
this
lever
here
this
yellow
one
Warren
what
are
you
trying
to
do
you
are
breaking
but
they
are
not
trains
they
are
vehicles
here
is
the
trains
the
bricks
are
too
big
well
put
the
bumpy
track
oh
dear
that
cheeky
car
driving
over
the
trains
what
is
it
doing
poor
Henry's
going
to
try
and
escape
choo
oh
no
he
is
stopped
why
has
he
stopped
because
he
is
got
no
coal
because
he
has
not
got
his
tender
on
where
is
his
tender
where
is
Henry's
tender
ah
there
it
is
can
you
see
it
over
there
Warren
by
your
vehicle
box
hooray
yeah
that
is
Henry's
tender
and
he
needs
it
because
it
is
got
the
coal
in
to
feed
him
so
he
can
go
fast
because
he
is
stopped
he
is
run
out_of
steam
because
he
is
got
no
coal
in
his
firebox
well
I
do
not
think
we
need
to
look
in
a
book
at
the
moment
do
we
let
us
get
Henry's
tender
on
which
book
I
do
not
