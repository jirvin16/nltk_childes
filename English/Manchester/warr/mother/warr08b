what
would
you
like
me
to
do
it
is
is
not
it
somebody
made
a
tower
you
cannot
break
that
tower
up
as
easily
as
that
you

do
it
carefully
what

is
it
the
trailer
you

a
pleasure
I
do

fit
if
you
are
careful
I
do
not
know
if
there
is
space
for
the
fish
to
sleep
in
the

I
think
a
bull
a
cow
a
penguin
and
a
chicken
is
quite
enough
to
sleep
in
the
car
if
you
took
these
out
the
fish
would
fit
in
I
think
not
stuck

a
weight
off
