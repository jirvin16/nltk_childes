that
is
right
there
should
not
be
a
monkey
in
there
should
there
because
monkeys
do
not
drive
trains
yeah
well
women
can
drive
trains
as_well
what
are
you
doing
never
mind
it
goes
back
on
what
is
coming
there
is
another
truck
behind
you
Warren
look
behind
you
look
right
behind
you
because
there
is
the
other
truck
there
no
behind
you
next_to
the
chair
there
we
go
well
the
thing
is
the
monkey
does
not
sit
on
things
like
that
he
kind
of
stands
on
it
if
you
move
his
arms
up
a
little
bit
one
the
other
one
now
you
stand
his
feet
on
here
his
feet
on
here
like
that
because
I
do
not
think
he
sits
down
on
things
he
might
sit
on
the
funnel
a
bit
of
a
hot
seat
I
think
you
would
call
it
oh
not
a
good
fit
shall
we
stand
him
on
here
again
or
on
the
cab
roof
he
normally
stands
up
rather
than
sits
down
that
is
the
funnel
yeah
that
is
going
to
be
a
very
tall
truck
look
at
all
those
bricks
I
hope
that
does
not
go
through
a
low
tunnel
great
Scott
there
is
a
horse
on
it
I
hope
that
horse
does
not
mind
heights
the
ambulance
is
in
your
vehicle
box
which
is
next_to
the
blue
box
Warren
that
is
a
horrible
noise
is
the
horse
all
right
up
there
he
is
not
scared
is
he
Warren
Warren
is
the
horse
all
right
up
there
he
is
not
scared
because
you
know
how
Jolly_tall
gets
scared
when
he
goes
up
high
does
not
he
I
am
glad
the
horse
is
okay
yeah
making
a
fence
here
oh
good
that
is
a
rather
strange
place
for
a
bit
of
fencing
but
never
mind
we
need
the
gates
do
not
we
if
I
put
that
there
then
we
can
have
the
gate
there
right
let
us
build
the
fence
a
bit
higher
put
a
cow
in
there
but
I
might
have
wanted
that
field
for
horses
or
chickens
where
are
the
chickens
I
would
like
some
chickens
in
my
field
please
can
you
find
me
some
chickens
now
what
is
happened
here
why
are
these
cows
sticking
together
that
is
it
oh
yes
there
is
that
wall
high
enough
round
the
field
oh
here
is
a
cow
coming
in
moo
close
the
gate
so
they
cannot
run
away
oh
no
there
is
a
savage
tiger
creeping
up
and
the
savage
tiger's
going
to
climb
over
the
wall
grr
I
do
not
think
we
would
want
to
close
the
tiger
in
really
but
never
mind
along
comes
super
pig
flys
in
sits
on
the
tiger's
back
and
the
tiger
turns
into
a
tame
animal
and
goes
to
sleep
there
is
super
pig
are
they
all
asleep
now
we
have
not
really
got
anything
to
use
as
a
blanket
unless
unless
we
use
the
doll's
dress
or
blouse
could
do
we
could
line
them
all
up
shall
we
cover
them
up
tuck
them
up
under
the
blanket
there
we
go
have
they
woken
up

escape
again
there
we
are
who
is
oh
poor
panda

give
him
a
cuddle

fit
into
the
field
sweet
gate
shut
animals
cannot
escape
except
for
the
tiger
who
can
jump
very
high

the
rampage

the
pig
sleeping
well
the
cow

the
bull
might
fit
in
this
way
if
we
pop
the
bull
in
next_to
the
cow
like
this
quick
get
the
gate
on
stop
that
tiger
from
escaping
where
is
the
car
going

go
if
it
cannot
go

the
field
where
have
they
been
in
the

Malta
that
was
a
long
drive
yeah

not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
even
if
it
knocked
the
gate
down
it
could
not
fit
in
because
its
wheels
are
too
wide
unless
it
climbed
over
the
top
of
the
wall
I
do
not
I
do
not
think
it
can
I
did
not
realize
that
was
an
ambulance
I
thought
it
was
an
ordinary
car
or
is
it
because
it
is
the
panda's
car
no
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
the
car's
too
wide
oh
no
it
is
not
going
to
drive
over
the
wall
is
it
but
there
is
no
driver
no
it
has
not
got
a
driver
in
who
is
going
to
drive
it
I
do
not
know
Warren
we
are
both
yawning
we
need
early
nights
tonight
who
might
put
Warren
to
bed
tonight
yeah
would
you
like
Paul
to
bath
you
and
put
you
to
bed
oh
would
you
like
Tom
to
Sue
Mummy
well
those
are
the
only
people
that
can
bath
you
and
put
you
to
bed
tonight
because
Daddy's
going
away
so
I
think
it
would
be
nice
if
Paul
did
Paul
came
and
saw
you
the
other
night
did
not
he
when
you
would
just
gone
you
were
just
having
your
story
they
are
be
not
they
that
lion
that
tiger's
going
to
run
away
very
fast
where
is
it
where
is
the
tiger
gone
grr
running
away
grr
he
is
going
to
bite
your
nose
oh
shall
it
kiss
your
nose
mm
lick
your
cheek
lick
lick
lick
oh
no
you
have
got
a
tiger
on
your
knee
oh
no
you
have
not
you
have
knocked
it
off
oh
he
is
sleeping
on
your
knee
oh
that
is
nice
he
is
a
nice
stripy
tiger
is
not
he
mhm
do
not
move
about
too
much
if
you
are
sleeping
oh
he
is
awake
I
do
not
think
that
oh
I
think
the
car's
wedged
now
do
not
you
a
wedged
car
oh
yes
thing
is
Warren
that
car
cheated
it
flew
cars
do
not
normally
fly
cars
do
not
fly
if
the
car's
in
the
field
where
are
all
the
animals
going
to
go
no
space
for
them
really
is
there
I
think
that
car
ought_to
come
out
and
let
the
animals
in
that
is
better
because
fields
are
for
animals
not
for
cars
those
poor
animals
got
no
field
sounds
a
good
idea
oh
that
is
nice
are
you
having
a
rest
you
are
having
a
rest
be
not
you
can
they
creep
past
the
car
into
the
bit
of
field
oh
the
car's
coming
out
I
think
these
animals
are
going
to
go
scampering
in
very
fast
and
shut
the
gate
so
the
car
cannot
come
in
right
the
tiger's
going
to
come
and
frighten
the
car
away
grr
a
brumm
but
the
car
is
sneaky
going
to
come
creeping
back
and
try
and
sneak
in
over
the
wall
here
but
the
tiger's
noticed
and
it
is
going
to
come
and
frighten
it
away
again
grr
a
Warren
do
you
need
your
pottie
Warren
stand
up
are
you
sure
and
you
do
not
need
anything
else
oh
oh
yes
yes
you
must
always
shut
gates
when
you
have
been
through
them
must
not
you
to
stop
creatures
from
escaping
oh
that
was
a
big
jump
was
not
it
that
gate
is
open
and
shut
an
awful
lot
is
not
it
well
who
is
going
to
join
the
cow
and
the
bull
and
the
baby
horse
and
the
pig
that
is
another
bull
a
black
bull
oh
yes
no
it
is
a
brown
and
white
bull
I
think
well
I
do
not
think
you
need
to
tip
it
all
out
I
do
not
think
that
is
a
good
idea
come
here
Warren
just
come
here
do
you
need
a
poo
are
you
sure
mhm
oh
where
are
all
those
bricks
oh
they
are
hidden
underneath
the
box
oh
yes
oh
here
is
here
is
the
Mummy
is
baby
tiger
going
to
have
a
ride
on
his
Mummy's
back
baby
tiger
will
fit
on
you
know
there
like
that
looks
a
bit
funny
though
does
not
it
the
giraffe's
got
into
the
field
that
is
it
what
happens
if
you
leave
the
gate
open
