see
a
piece
with
some
number
on
to
go
here
just
moved
it
that
is
it
look
now
he
goes
he
goes
near
the
back
can
you
see
a
piece
where
does
that
piece
go
no
it
is
the
blue
flashing
light
there
is
another
broken
blue
light
there
do
you
think
those
pieces
go
together
if
you
put
those
pieces
together
will
it
mend
the
blue
light
hooray
yeah
that
goes
right
at
the
back
this
goes
somewhere
over
here
that
goes
in
there
a
firefighter
on
the
phone
and
a
firefighter
driving
oh
look
there
is
a
broken
helmet
there
with
no
face
underneath
it
can
you
mend
it
by
putting
that
piece
in
no
that
goes
there
I
think
that
piece
goes
here
look
there
is
a
man's
leg
with
a
bit
taken
out_of
it
and
there
is
a
piece
of
leg
that
is
it
now
there
is
the
man's
body
that
goes
on
the
legs
can
you
fit
the
man's
body
onto
his
legs
that
is
it
and
you
have
mended
the
wheel
as_well
because
there
was
a
piece
taken
out_of
the
wheel
now
can
you
mend
this
sliding
door
here
the
bit
that
slides
down
and
covers
the
hose
the
top
bit's
missing
can
you
mend
it
hooray
and
you
have
mended
his
helmet
look
now
we
have
got
two
pieces
left
we
have
got
that
piece
and
that
piece
which
one
goes
where
try
it
the
other
way
round
turn
it
round
excuse
you
that
is
it
now
where
does
this
piece
go
that
is
the
hat
but
where
where
is
the
face
to
go
under
the
hat
that
is
it
brilliant
finished
how
many
firefighters
are
there
that
is
very
good
except
you
counted
one
of
them
twice
how
many
blue
lights
it
is
is
not
it
and
what
is
this
do
you
know
what
this
is
that
is
a
light
a
very
strong
light
a
floodlight
in
fact
and
when
they
switch
that
on
so
if
they
have_to
go
to
a
fire
in
the
dark
they
can
see
what
is
going
on
when
they
have
stopped
the
fire
and
they
can
see
where
all
the
hoses
are
and
they
can
see
how
where
to
put
the
key
in
to
unlock
