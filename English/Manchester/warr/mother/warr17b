you
looked
down
and
you
saw
smoke
did
not
you
what
else
did
you
see
yesterday
you
went
on
the
train
last
week
yes
on
Sunday
you
went
on
the
train
did
not
you
it
was
not
really
a
special
train
was
not
a
train
like
this
one
though
was
it
was
it
it
was
an
electric
train
was
not
it
that
you
went
on

which
man
which
man
there
are
lots_of
men
cannot
see
any
though
ahhah
whoops
oh
now
I
have
destroyed
the
train
is
he
going
to
sit
on
the
elephant
you
can
make
what
you
like
darling
one
are
you
putting
a
fence
round
the
field
so
things
cannot
escape
that
is
the
cow
that
is
the
cow's
udder
that
is
where
you
get
milk
from
no
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will

yeah
you
want
Mummy
to
make
a
field
so
what
do
you
have_to
say
well
I
think
you
would
better
keep
your
baby
tigers
away
from
here
because
your
baby
tigers
might
get
mixed
up
with
Anna's
baby
tigers
might
not
they
you
put
your
baby
tigers
on
here
and
they
can
watch
no
well
if
they
get
put
in
the
box
by
mistake
let
us
make
the
field
then
shall
we
shall
we
make
it
a
nice
big
field
so
the
animals
have
got
lots_of
space
shall
we
make
the
fence
a
bit
higher
yeah
there
is
a
slight
problem
with
this
field
that
Mummy's
made
do
you
know
what
that
is
you
cannot
actually
get
out_of
it
let
us
have
some
of
these
mhm
we
could
have
a
little
gate
here
could
not
we
look
there
is
a
gate
so
the
animals
can
get
out
yeah
if
we
put
that
in
front
we
can
move
that
cannot
we
when
the
animals
want
to
get
out
so
we
have
got
a
cow
in
the
field
what
else
shall
we
have
in
the
field
have
another
cow
how
many
cows
have
we
got
now
that
is
right
what
other
animals
shall
we
shall
we
put
in
a
horse
how
many
animals
now
no
how
many
animals
all
together
no
count
them
that
is
right
three
animals
let
us
put
another
one
in
let
us
put
that
bull
in
how
many
animals
are
there
now
you
put
your
baby
tiger
in
if
you
like
all
these
animals
my_goodness
lots
be
not
there
I
am
sure
it
feels
safe
having
baby
tigers
in
with
the
horses
and
cows
shall
we
put
let
us
put
the
monkey
on
the
side
what
is
he
doing
that
monkey
mhm
oh
that
is
nice
do
you
like
hugging
monkeys
looks
as_if
the
baby
tiger's
licking
him
does
not
it
that
is
what
it
looks
like
the
baby
tiger
doing
is
he
licking
no
no
good
would
you
like
to
be
licked
by
a
baby
tiger
no
I
would
not
either
well
which
cream
are
you
going
to
put
on
that
is
not
cream
pet
who
are
you
telephoning
who
are
you
telephoning
well
you
would
better
talk
to
them
then
pull
the
aerial
up
and
talk
to
them
that
is
it
they
are
on
now
I
can
hear
them
they
are
saying
hello
say
hello
oh
do
not
keep
your
finger
on
it
it
is
a
horrible
noise
was
it
sounded
more
like
somebody
testing
the
power
on
their
mobile
phone
to
me
but
there
we
go
well
you
see
that
has_to
go
there
so_that
if
the
animals
want
to
come
out_of
the
field
you
can
just
open
it
up
and
they
can
come
out
and
then
you
can
close
it
again
to
make
sure
the
other
animals
do
not
escape
and
they
are
all
standing
here
looking
over
because
they
want
to
come
out
too
oh
they
are
fall
they
have
gone
to
sleep
I
think
what
have
they
been
drinking
oh
no
they
are
escaping
where
are
they
going
going
to
hospital
why
what
are
they
going
to
have
done
at
the
hospital
they
are
going
to
have
lunch
at
the
hospital
that
is
a
good
idea
is
not
it
I
expect
hospitals
do
lovely
lunches
I
have
never
seen
such
a
thing
have
they
got_to
hospital
yet
no
Anna's
baby
tiger
does
not
come
off
the
green
bit
see
your
baby
tigers
look
like
Anna's
except
Anna's
is
sitting
on
a
bit
of
grass
and
yours
is
not
no
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
no
it
is
not
supposed
to
come
off
I
do
not
think
no
it
is
not
supposed
to
come
off
they
are
just
different
kinds
of
baby
tigers
oh
poor
baby
tiger
I
do
not
think
it

the
baby

that
is
being

taking
them

Warren
Warren

bring
the
baby

think

Anna's
baby
tiger
has
been
naughty
you
would
better
put
it
back
in
the
box
and
if
it
is
your
