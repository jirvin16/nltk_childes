the
digger's
outside
no
the
digger's
outside
and
wet
and
dirty
you
could
put
them
in
the
dumper
truck
well
we
will
see
but
I
think
it
is
dirty
because
we
have
been
digging
in
the
garden
with
it
oh
dear
did
you
go
splashing
in
puddles
yesterday

what
happened

you
went
splashing
in
those
puddles
what
happened
come
back
over
here
sweetheart
and
finish
off
your
drawing
or
I
am
trying
to
think
what
else
you
could
put
your
crayons
in
I
think
you
could
probably
put
some
in
the
tractor
trailer
you
know
right
we
just
need
the
yellow
bit
off
the
top
do
not
we
now
I
wonder
where
that
is
here
it
is
yeah
I
am
sure
you
can
fit
lots
in
if
you
put
them
in
carefully
you
will
be
able
to
stack
them
up
it
is
I
do
not
know
where
the
other
bit
is
mhm
you
did
did
not
you
but
that
was
when
you
were
very
little
was
not
it
you
did
not
know
then
that
you
were
not
supposed
to
chew
crayons
you
know
now
do
not
you
these
all
in
the
trailer
it
is
a
little
one
is
not
it
that
one
was
broken
was
not
it
I
think
you
trod
on
it
mhm
and
what
is
wrapped
round
the
crayon
a
bit
or
paper
is
not
it
oh
yes
is
that
the
same
color
as
the
other
one
are
they
the
same
color
you
are
right
it
is
it
is
that
is
a
long
green
one
is
not
it
well
that
is
a
different
crayon
that
is
a
different
kind
of
green
is
not
it
it
is
is
not
it
but
it
is
still
got
the
sharp
point
on
it
has
not
it
which
is
good
for
drawing
well
it
is
not
sharp
it
is
a
point
I
am
not
sure
that
they
will
all
fit
on
actually
some
of
them
might
you
will
have_to
drive
very
carefully
with
all
those
crayons
in
the
trailer
oh
you
would
better
move
those
trains
before
they
get
run
over
oh
no
two
have
fallen
off
oh
no
what
shall
we
do
oh
that
was
a
big
rev
of
the
engine
was
not
it

a
Paf
puzzle
a
who

this
right
at

bottom

is
better
if
you
