she
that

they
are
not
stripy
ones
like
yours
though
are
they
she

I
think
she
needs
to
keep
her
pants
on
because
you
keep
your
pants
on
do
not
you
dolly
wants
to
keep
her
pants
on
that
is
the
cab
of
the
locomotive
that
is
actually
the
funnel
but
never
mind
that
is
right
and
you
have
got
a
cab
and
a
foot
you
went
on
the
foot
of
a
steam
train

not
you

did
do
you
remember
that
hot
hot
fire
that
we
saw
with
the
firemen
putting
lots_of
coal
on
well
that
is
a
funny
place
to
sit
on
top
of
the
cab
roof
is
that
so
he
gets
a
good
view
of
where
he
is
going
that
is
a
good
idea
is
he
going
to
put
some
more
water
in
the
tender
as_well
Warren
you
have_to
make
sure
it
is
sort
of
square
on
the
engine
you
need
to
move
over
a
little
bit
that
is
it
how
many
trailers
are
there
you
can
put
whatever
you
like
on
it
I
guess
oh
yeah

color
is
it
why
do
not

leave
the
man
on
whoops

the
television
and
he
is
wearing
red
stripy
pants
he
has
got
red
stripy
pants
on
red
and
white
stripes
they
are
very
smart
let
us
pull
your
trousers
up
before
something
desperate
happens
shall
I
put
a
dress
on
the
doll
so
she
does
not
get
cold
I
think
she
is
getting
cold
some
of
her
hair's
falling
out
is
not
it
it
is
a
right
tip
like
Mummy's
hair
is
sometimes
that
is
better
can
you
redo
her
hair
then
she
can
have
a
nice
bow
is
not
that
a
nice
bow
do
you
want
that
in
your
hair
would
Warren
like
a
bow
in
his
hair
I
will
see
who
that
is
I
do
not
think
your
hair's
long
enough
now
you
look
like
one
of
those
little
Yorkshire
terriers
oh
Shirley_Temple
eat
your
heart
out
you
look
a
right
duckie
look
in
the
look
in
the
television
look
at
your
hair
with
your
bow
can
you
see
it
you
look
just
like
Shirley_Temple
the
dolly's
hair
needs
combing
really
does
not
it
I
have
not
got
a
comb
can
you
pass
me
the
bow
please
can
you
pass
me
the
red
ribbon
right
just
bring
it
over
to
me
because
I
do
not
want
you
to
that
is
it
thank_you
I
will
undo
this
you
having
done
it
up
nice
and
tight
are
you
going
to
choose
something
for
the
doll
to
wear
so
you
should
be
choose
something
for
the
doll
to
wear
please
well
make
a
field
then
there
is
the
big
board
who
are
you
going

look
she
is
cold
what
should
she
wear
right
let
us
put
her
blouse
on
underneath
then
put
her
arms
in
I
thought
she
was
wearing
the
trousers
pet
I
think
the
trousers
are
a
good
idea
because
it
is
a
bit
cold
outside
is
not
it
you
need
nice
warm
clothes
on
when
it
is
cold
