pumpy
pumpying
whatever
pumpy
pumpy
pumpying
is
I
am
worn
out
your
dumper
truck's
here
Warren
but
I
think
before
you
get
your
dumper
truck
out
you
ought_to
put
your
tea
set
away
because
you
might
damage
it
I
know
where
you
could
put
your
tea
set
actually
you
could
put
it
in
your
dumper
truck
get
it
out
from
the
garage
do
not
throw
them
in
put
them
in
gently
put
them
in
gently
oh
are
we
keeping
you
up
no
do
not
look
you
are
not
being
gentle
with
this
you
have_to
put
it
on
and
make
sure
it
is
right
before
you
start
leaning
on
it
where
is
the
garage
is
it
just
over
there
I
do
not
think
it
is
gone
anywhere
no
no
no
you
stay
here
Warren
there
is
not
a
garage
Warren
shut
the
door
please
shut
the
door
garage
garage
come
back
Warren
there
is
no
garage
out
here
come
on
the
garage
is
upstairs
well
it
is
not
a
garage
anyway
it
is
baby
Jesus's
shed
I
know
you
think
it
is
a
garage
but
it
is
not
it
is
a
shed
where
baby
Jesus
was
born
I
know
you
think
it
is
a
garage
but
it
is
not
what
are
you
doing
that
is
a
good
idea
is
not
it
right
just
let
Mummy
put
the
box
like
that
what
a
clever
boy
are
you
going
to
tip
some
more
into
the
box
do
not
put
the
baby
tiger
in
brilliant
it
is
probably
easier
to
just
put
it
straight
in
the
box
but
not
as
much
fun
is
it
right
let
us
get
the
box
lined
up
shall
we
would
you
like
to
drive
a
tipper
truck
when
you
are
grown
up
now
is
there
any
more
of
your
tea
set
that
needs
to
go
in
the
box
can
you
put
the
rest
of
your
tea
set
away
please
why
do
not
you
put
the
other
knife
and
saucer
in
oh
there
is
another
knife
there
as_well
a
blue
knife
um
I
am
not
sure
that
is
a
good
idea
it
is
supposed
to
be
able
to
withstand
an
elephant
standing
on
it
so
it
might
be
able
to
cope
with
you
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
you
can
sit
on
it
I
suppose
well
the
thing
is
you
see
you
might
fall
off
it
and
hurt
yourself
or
you
might
fall
backwards
into
this
and
get
your
bottom
wedged
in
the
dumper
truck
in
the
dumper
bit
and
then
you
would
not
be
able
to
move
you
would
have_to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
with
a
dumper
truck
wedged
round
your
bottom
and
then
you
would
look
silly
well
yes
you
have_to
put
the
rubble
in
before
you
can
tip
it
out
though
do
not
you
mhm
it
does
not
really
look
like
rubble
to
me
that
looks
more
like
a
minicar
shall
I
put
this
away
gosh
that
dumper
truck's
acting
like
a
snowplow
is
not
it
why
well
do
not
no
do
not
drive
over
things
with
your
dumper
truck
because
that

how
things
get
broken
I
know
your
tea
set's
only
plastic
but
that
is
beside
the
point
very
gentle
the
thing
is
you
cannot
scoop
with
the
dumper
truck
can
you
you
can
only
dump
things
with
it
you
could
always
your
digger
might
be
able
to
scoop
well
your
digger's
up
there
why
do
not
you
try
scooping
with
your
digger
on
the
top
box
no
your
digger's
not
in
that
box
your
digger's
not
in
the
vehicle
box
it
is
in
the
big
box
there
it
is
whoops
you
have
been
picking
your
labels
off
these
have
not
you
oh
you
have
scooped
up
a
cup
where
are
you
going
to
put
it
okay
and
where
is
the
garage
that
is
it
I
am
not
sure
whether
that'll
be
very
good
at
picking
up
big
things
that
is
good
for
little
things
why
do
not
you
try
putting
some
more
cutlery
in
as_well
perhaps
a
couple
of
spoons
as_well_as
the
fork
