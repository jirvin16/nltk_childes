it
then
if

yours
no
do
not
do
not
bash
them
with

bashing
with

kicking
is
not

feet
please
oh
yes
you
are
moving
it
about
be
not
you
what
is
that
what
color
excellent
always
a
safe
bet
asking
the
color
of
something
that
is
red
shall
we
put
a
yellow
one
on
the
top
shall
I
put
you
on
the
top
then

gone
no
do
not
kick
it
that
is
right
you
can
bash
with
your
hands
but
not
with
your
feet
well
you
build
another
tower
then
you
can
bash
it
down
cannot
you
yeah
go
on
then
bash
it
hey
of
course
it
is
more
exciting
if
you
have
a
big
tower
I
think
to
bash
it
you
build
a
really
tall
tower
find
some
more
bricks
and
build
a
tall
tower
then
bash
it
who
is
that
why
do
not
you
count

more
than
two
spots
how
many
are
there
one
two
three
four
five
spots
well
not
bad
how
many
spots

does
not
usually
wear
a
top
hat
that

the
Controller
the
Fat_Controller

a
random
picture
you
put
the
last
two
