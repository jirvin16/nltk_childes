came
off
yeah
but
why
did
it
come
off
why
was
not
it
moving
because
you
were
running
over
my
toes
that
is
why
did
they
why
do
not
you
play

one
of
your
puzzles
or
something
or
are
you
happy
with
your

which

can
I
have
a
look
at
your
new

keep
it
out_of
my
t
well
if
you
did
not
try
sticking
it
down
my
t
I
would
not
push
it
away
would
I
where
is
it
going
well
I
cannot
really
go
away
because
if
I
went
away
when
Anna
came
to
leave
you
would
be
all
by
yourself
in
the
house
noone
to
cook
you
your
tea
and
then
what
would
you
do
you
did
you

picked
you
up
from
Nana's
did
not
you
who
did
you
want
to
pick
you
up
yeah
inferior
Mummy
came
did
not
she
be
careful
because
this
vehicle's
not
very
secure
can
you
see
it
moving
about
it
is
really
which
one
are
you
after
oh
okay
let
us
find
the
rest
of
the
caravan
then
just
mind
out_of
the
way
well
it
is
not
much
of
a
caravan
when
it
is
just
the
bottom
bit
it
is
not
even
got
any
wheels
sweetheart
there
is
the
top
bit
now
where
are
the
dratted
wheels

they
are
there
oh
are
you
just
pulling
it
round
do
you
not
want

sledge
than
a
caravan

you
want
to
mend
the
caravan

it
looks
like
a
caravan
