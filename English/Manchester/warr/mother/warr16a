wake
up
Granny
going

the
kangaroo
is

I
think
what
we
need

do
tomorrow
Warren
is
to
make
some
play
because
this
is
rubbish
really
is
not
it
not
very
good
that
is
a
good
boy
putting
all
those
bits
in
the
pot
you
might
need
the
prodding
stick
to
get
it
out
prodding
with
your
finger
shall
Mummy
old
it
while
you
prod
with
your
finger
now
if
you
prod
where
his
tail
is

Granny
kangaroo
on
it
whoops
tell
you
what
we
will
put
Granny
at
the
front
the
kangaroo

the
back
they
are
it

you
see
that
is
the
problem
because
it
is
some
old
play
why
do
not
you
try
rolling
it

I
have
flattened
it
a

I
hope
the
van
does
not
want
to
go
on
the
plane

Malta
because
there
is
not
space
for
it
does
the
van
want
to
go
to

play
was
new
now
you
peel
those
bits
off
and
put
them
in
the
pot
oh
that
is
a
big
piece
does
that
make
it
easier
to
put
it
in
the
pot
when
it
is
in
little
pieces
shall
Mummy
hold
it
while
you
prod
with
your
finger
or
do
you
want
to
use
the
prodding
stick
watch
it
you
will
get
your
