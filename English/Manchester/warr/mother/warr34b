giraffe
well
it
is
not

it
because
it
might
get
mixed
up
that
is
a
good
noise
you
obviously
do
not
think

but
you
have
still
not

I
think
it
was
in
the
tree
outside
we
need
to
get
some
more
nuts
do
not
we
for
that
bird
mind
you
they
do
not
eat
many
nuts
in
summer
perhaps
we
will
go
out
this
afternoon
and
find
some
nuts
for
the
birds
shall
we
go
shopping
this
afternoon
we
could
go
to
Wellington
could
not
we
to
buy
some
nuts
and
there
is
something
else
we
need
as_well
I
cannot
remember
what
it
is
something
else
exciting
like
bird
nuts
maybe
actually
if
we
go
to
Wellington
we
might
be
able
to
buy
one
of
those
very
strong
bird
feeders
made
of
metal
and
wood
it
will
last
longer
than
those
little
bags
although
there
be
not
many
squirrels
here
I
have
not
seen
any
squirrels
we
had
to
have
a
strong
bird
at
home
did
not
at
our
last
house
did
not
we
because
the
squirrels
came
and
ripped
those
bags
apart
I
have
not
seen
any
squirrels
here
have
you
no
oh
no
what
can
we
do
get
you
up
oh
what
a
heavy
boy
you
keep
falling
off
oh
I
cannot
you
are
too
heavy
I
cannot
pull
you
up
dolly's
going
to
help
you
are
too
heavy
I
will
just
have_to
leave
you
like
that
that
is
a
shame
because
you
cannot
eat
your
punch
if
you
are
lying
like
that
cannot
have
your
ham
sandwich
or
your
spreaded
cheese
sandwich
oh
now
why
have
you
suddenly
sat
up
is
it
the
thought
of
lunch
good
though
how
you
can
want
lunch
after
several
cakes
I
do
not
know
what
kind
of
animals
are
they
looking
for
eerrgh
eerrgh
that
elephant's
cheeky
is
not
it
eerrgh
you
woke
up
last
night
did
not
you
and
cried
because
your
elephant
had
fallen
out_of
bed
do
you
remember
that
Warren
do
you
remember
crying
and
saying
I
want
my
elephant
and
I
came
up
and
said
your
elephant's
about
six
inches
away
from
the
edge
of
your
bed
why
cannot
you
get
him
and
you
said
no
Mummy
get
him
I
want
my
elephant
a
softie
Mummy
got
the
elephant
for
you
of
course
watch
it
the
panda
might
jump
in
oh
no
the
panda's
fallen
out
poor
panda
well
his
legs
because
his
legs
are
a
bit
stiff
be
not
they
do
you
want
your
nose
wiping
you
are
disgusting
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
going
I
shall
attack
you
with
it
where
is
your
snozzle
mhm
why
is
it
parked
up
is
the
driver
having
his
lunch
or
a
cup
of
tea
oh
is
that
to
let
the
sunshine
in
oh
it
is
just
to
let
the
rain
in
is
it
because
he
is
hot
why
is
the
top
of
his
cab
open
then
right
oh
right
well
it
is
a
good
idea
to
have
your
cab
closed
if
it
is
raining
it
is
like
those
cars
without
lids
that
you
see
they
normally
put
their
lids
back
on
if
it
starts
to
rain
no
I
do
not
think
it
did
rain
yesterday
did
it
rain
when
we
were
on
holiday
yeah
it
did
did
not
it
it
rained
nearly
every
day
and
do
you
remember
Warren
going
to
see
all
those
tractors
and
engines
in
the
mud
do
you
remember
that
muddy
field
and
you
wore
your
wellies
and
Mummy
and
Charlie
wore
sandals
and
they
got
very
muddy
bare
feet
and
we
went
stamping
in
puddles
do
you
remember
and
the
tractors
had
to
rescue
some
of
the
vehicles
because
they
were
stuck
in
the
mud
do
you
remember
seeing
that
tractor
pulling
that
very
old
fire
it
was
stuck
in
the
mud
it
did
pull
very
hard
and
they
were
throwing
straw
everywhere
were
not
they
so
the
cars
would
not
get
stuck
and
you
listened
to
the
music
playing
you
and
Charlie
stood
and
listened
to
the
music
oh
dear
are
your
feet
stuck
in
the
mud
is
it
hard
work
no
pushing

not
a
good
idea
shall
I
get
coupled
up
to
you
then
and
then
we
can
both
pull
cannot
we
right
I
am
coupled
on
there
we
go
we
are
out_of
the
mud
we
are
uncoupled
now
are
you
stuck
I
am
stuck
but
I
just
coupled
onto
you
and
pulled
you
out_of
the
mud
why
have
you
gone
back
in
the
mud
do
I
need
to
couple
on
or
can
I
just
push
well
I
will
pull
because
that
is
safer
give
me
your
hands
little
stuck
engine
and
I
will
pull
buffers
actually
not
arms
pull
poor
little
stuck
engine
pull
pull
you
out_of
the
mud
oh
no
your
trousers
what
shall
we
do
with
you
Warren
that
is
a
funny
noise
Warren
you
are
mad
