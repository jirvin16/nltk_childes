a
crash
helmet
brumm
shall
the
crazy
driver
come

oh
he
ran
over
your

that
is
a
dangerous

shall
I
go
over
there
shall
I
come
over
here
let
us
have
a
look
not
quite
now
then
do
you
want
a
very
tall
train
because
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
tall
train
at
the
moment
let
us
just
sort
it
out
then
we
can
have
a
tall
train
look
at
that
tall
train
chuff
right
brumm
that
is
a
very
tall
train
is
not
it
no
I
think
the
car's
on
the
track
that
car
had
better
move
brumm
crazy
driver
I
think
that
train
driver's
a
crazy
driver
a
well
do
not
you
oh
dear
do
not
think
so
no
going
to
make
a
tunnel
poop
oh
no
there
is
been
a
train
crash
is
it
well
panda
cars
that
is
what
you
call
police
cars
the
train's
had
a
crash
he
needs
a
kiss
oh
naughty
rabbit
did
not
put
his
hand
in
front
of
his
mouth
that
is
it
that
is
a
good
boy
you
are
saying
ouch
I
think
I
will
get
out_of
the
train's
way
on
this
chair
do
not
like
being
run
over
by
trains
that
is
a
good
idea
because
a
locomotive
is
very
big
is
not
it
it
is
tall
you
can
have
a
tall
tower
on
the
back
is
it
tall
enough
now
that
is
a
nice
tower
is
not
it
very
fancy
shape
is
it
tall
enough
yet
it
did
did
not
it
oh
no
what
a
disaster
that
is
better
that
is
a
stronger
tower
is
not
it
you
certainly
are
oh
you
did
did
not
you
oh
right
I
am
sorry
does
Warren
not
go
crash
a
you
have
got
only
got
one
blue
brick
on
your
tower
have
not
you
right
at
the
bottom
oh
no
it
is
fallen
off
again
that
was
not
entirely
successful
was
it
Warren
shall
I
show
you
a
good
way
to
make
it
stronger
if
you
get
this
big
brick
put
it
right
across
there
that'll
help
to
make
it
stronger
and
then
the
whole
thing
fell
apart
rather
than
just
one
brick
oh
well
thing
is
Warren
if
you
try
pushing
bits
on
the
sticky
out
bits
it
will
fall
apart
if
you
stick
them
on
the
main
bit
of
the
tower
oh
dear
pardon
you
want
to
throw
a
tissue
no
you
cannot
hey
ho
I
do
not
know
you
threw
it
mate
that
is
the
problem
with
throwing
things
you
do
not
always
know
where
they
go
no
throw
a
piece
again
and
they
all
go
away
and
they
go
straight
back
in
Anna's
car
yes
right
let
us
put
them
away
then
oh
how
strange
I
thought
you
said
I
do
not
want
these
are
you
building
a
fence
are
the
cows
going
in
the
field
where
is
the
gate
going
to
go
right
it
is
quite
big
is
it
if
you
say
it
is
only
little
darling
it
is
only
little
that
bit's
sticking
out
is
not
it
what
color's
the
piece
that
is
sticking
out
what
about
the
other
piece
that
is
sticking
out

noticed
why
are
you
moving

are
you

is
space
for
the
baby
tiger
bridge

you
like

we
try
and
make
it
wide
enough
for
the
car

me

lots_of
big
pieces
on
