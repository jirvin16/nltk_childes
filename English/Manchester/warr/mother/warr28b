in
together
trying

later
some
people
who
are

bomb
site

makes
a
good
noise
does
not
it
the
car
going
over
that
can
you
see
the
bits
of
gate
there
we
go
is
that
to
keep
animals
in
or
out
no
it
cannot
can
it
I
have
not
taken
these
bricks
from
any
of
your
things
Warren
I
have
just
taken
them
from
where
they
were
sitting
by
my
knee
it
is
interesting
peeping
because
you
see
the
reflections
in
the
bricks
excuse
you
Warren
what
is
what
oh
yes
oh
yes
that
is
a
bull
a
Daddy
cow
there
is
a
bull
and
a
cow
a
bull
is
like
a
Daddy
cow
and
a
cow
is
like
a
Mummy
cow
and
a
Warren
cow
is
a
calf
that
is
the
baby
cow
the
little
boy
cow
no
that
is
a
horse
dear
let
us
look
for
a
baby
cow
I
do
not
know
if
there
is
a
baby
cow
actually
is
that
a
baby
cow
no
it
is
a
sheepdog
not
much
difference
I
cannot
find
a
baby
cow
maybe
there
is
not
one
oh
you
have
got
a
goat
course
it
can
remember
the
monkey
has_to
stand
on
its
feet
push
its
feet
on
it
bends
over
with
its
bottom
stuck
up
in
the
air
look
you
have_to
put
it
on
like
that
I
think
there
you
go
what
is
the
monkey
saying
as
the
train
drives
along
whoops
oh
look
at
that
what
shall
we
do
I
think
that
is
a
bit
of
a
high
load
perhaps
you
ought_to
spread
it
out
and
have
some
on
one
truck
and
some
on
another
rather
than
it
all
being
on
one
truck
I
think
there
are
only
two
well
you
can
use
your
trailer
but
you
must
remember
that
it
is
your
trailer
and
not
Anna's
all
right
otherwise
Anna
will
take
it
home
shall
we
remember
that
that
is
yours
look
at
that
that
is
a
long
train
is
not
it
right
how
many
trailers
have
you
got
rubbish

many
have
you
got
three
trailers
that
is
right
and
one
engine
it
is
is
not
it
those
are
very
high
crumbs
I
hope
they
do
not
come
to
a
low
bridge
I
do
not
think
I
can
make
a
bridge
high
enough
let
us
have
a
go
let
us
try
making
a
very
high
bridge
can
you
pass
me
some
more
bricks

that
is
because
you
are
not
looking

have
got_to
try
and
make
this
bridge
big
enough
for
that
train
to
go

the
trailer
fit
through
though
you
think
so

the
baby
tiger
sit
on
top
and
just

Warren

made
an
especially
high
bridge
