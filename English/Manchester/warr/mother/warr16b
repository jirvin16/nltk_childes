want
the
funnel
and

dome
we
saw
some
real
trains
did
not
we
Warren
with
funnels
and
domes
when
we
went
to
the
museum
with
Katie
and
Charlie
do
you
remember
and
we
saw
all
those
steam
machines
going
with
steam
and
smoke
coming
out
and
pistons
moving
it
was
exciting
was
not
it
yes
you
did
you
went
in
the
garden
and
when

went
into
Manchester
oh

saw
the
mini
trains
did
not
we
on

behind
a
mini

did
not
you
you
did
hold
on
to
your
hats
yes
where
is
that
monkey
going
to
go
on
the
roof
shall
I
hold
the
train
still
while
you
put
it
on
it
does
fit
on
there
somehow
I
just
need
that
is
it
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
will
not
yes
he
will
because
the
funnel's
there
it
will
come
right
up
and
go
whoosh
in
his
eyes
and

will
go
a
and

go
swing
swing

of
Mummy
on
the
little
train
well
it
will
get
dirty

the
man
can
always
wash

cannot
he
because
that
is
the
best
way
to
keep
a
train
nice
and
clean
to
give
it
a
good
wash
at
the
end
of
a
day's
work

are
you
taking
your
trousers

it
because
it

a
new
skill
you
have
just
learned
the
slight
problem
is
your
braces

still
attached
at
the
back
so
you
cannot
actually
pull
them
down
Warren

cannot
have
everything
where
are
you

Warren
you
will
just
have_to
wait
pet
I
am
sorry
you
will
just
have_to
wait
yeah
I
know
it
is
just
not
a
good
time
no
you
are
not
walking
anywhere
mate
Warren
did

chilly
for
birds
have
they
have
they
gone
to
sleep
well
birds
sleep
in
very
special
beds
called
nests
they
are
not
big
boys
beds
like
yours
they
do
peck
at
the
nuts
but
I
do
not

think
it
is
a
bit
late
for
them
now
it
is
getting
a
bit
starting
to
get
dark
yeah
will
you
stop
fiddling
with
your
trousers
are
you
pulling
it
up
that
is
a
good
good
boy

a
hug
for
that
hey

we
have
a
man
riding
the
horse
it
is
a
very
big
horse
slightly
deformed
as_well
it
is
already
got
