to
the
green

green
ones

arch
do
you
want
the
other
men
shall
Mummy
help
you
to
look
yes
there
are
there
are
two
men
somewhere
oh
I
thought
that
was
a
man
but
it
is
a
baby
tiger
do
not
know
where
these
men
are
Warren
a
here
is
one
here
is
one
I
am
looking
for
the
other
one
I
am
finding
all
sorts
of
things
Warren
but
not
not
the
other
man
we
have
not
seen
these
before
have
we
Warren
the
sheep
and
the
chickens
the
cow
and
the
calf
I
think
the
other
man
has
got
a
green
base
has
not
it
thank_you
oh
that
is
a
new
one
look
oh
Warren
what
is
this
choo
shall
we
put
the
truck
on
the
train
no
it
is
not
Henry
because
Henry's
green
okay
fine
well
I
do
not
know
where
the
other
man
is
Warren
now
these
look
like
something
from
a
horror
film
he
is
not
there
the
other
man
I
do
not
think
is
in
here
I
think
the
other
man
might
be
having
a
little
holiday
somewhere
somewhere
nice
and
warm
perhaps
just
feel
how
cold
the
doll
is
okay
I
think
that
man's
gone
somewhere
nice
and
warm
yeah
just
two
men
well
there
is
a
man
here
but
this
man's
got
legs
you
see
because
he
is
the
train
driver
you
see
and
he
sits
in
the
train
what
is
it
what
is
it
mhm
oh
I
think
it
probably
is
stuck
on
the
bricks
yes
that
is
it
it
is
like
a
sun
is
not
it
shall
we
put
the
baby
tiger
on
the
sun
okay
yes
that
one'll
go
on
there
I
think
let
us
just
see
there
we
go
a
whale
on
the
sun
is
that
too
big
we
could
have
a
penguin
on
the
sun
perhaps
um
the
baby
whale
on
the
funnel
maybe
maybe
not
is
that
too
big
yes
I
do
not
think
it
will
fit
on
I
can
balance
it
on
a
bit
hot
do
not
you
think
choo
reversing
look
what
is
this
at
the
front
here
do
you
know
what
it
is
it
is
a
cow
catcher
it
is
like
what
Toby_the_Tram_Engine
has
so_that
things
cannot
get
stuck
under
his
wheels
at
the
front
things
like
cows
Warren
just
look
at
your
tower
yeah
you
knocked
that
down
you
sat
on
it
my
love
and
it
fell
down
yeah
you
mind
what
you
do
with
your
bottom
there
you
go
coupling
it
up
the
cow
catcher
looks
a
bit
like
the
snowplow
that
Thomas
had
did
not
it
in
the
story
about
the
village
getting
cut
off
why
do
you
want
to
see
her
tummy
her
trousers
mind
you
I
suppose
cousin
Tom
has
got
long
hair
so
you
might
think
it
was
a
man
but
Tom
does
not
have
bows
in
his
hair
does
he
well
undo
the
velcro
at
the
back
and
you
take
the
blouse
off
take
the
other
arm
out
that
is
it
oh
poor
dolly
she
is
got
no
clothes
on
a
bare
doll
right
let
us
help
if
you
do
that
shall
we
put
her
pants
on
is
that
a
good
idea
right
now
what
do
we
have_to
do
we
have_to
thread
her
feet
in
do
not
we
thread
them
in
thread
the
left
foot
and
the
right
foot
oh
she
is
standing
on
her
head
there
we
go
she
is
got
oh
her
tummy's
gone
has
not
it
now
we
are
putting
her
dress
on
and
we
thread
her
arms
through
the
arm
holes
okay
right
arm
through
there
can
you
thread

left
arm
through
there
oh
let
us
fasten
her
dress
oh
nice
dolly
that
is
a
pretty
dress
is
not
it
I
think
this
goes
on
with
this
dress
shall
we
put
her
fancy
collar
on
I
do
not
know
what
is
it
doing
on
the
floor
oh
dear
no
you
did
not
bang
it
with
your
bottom
that
time
I
think
it
just
fell
over
oh
look
look
at
these
extra
animals
there
is
even
a
goat
do
you
know
a
song
about
a
sheep
what
color
is
the
sheep
in
the
song
that
is
a
very
tall
tower
look
oh
no
that
is
it
what
a
tall
tower
where
is
that
man
now
where
is
he
yeah
one
man
high
up
one
man
low
down
yeah
are
you
making
another
tall
tower
I
think
the
tiger's
too
big
to
go
on
that
little
tower
the
baby
tiger
would
fit
choo
here
is
the
baby
tiger
on
the
sun
here
we
go
what
is
the
elephant
doing
mhm
I
hope
it
is
not
going
to
crash
because
that
would
hurt
the
elephant
and
the
baby
tiger
and
the
driver
it
is
is
not
it
oh
well
never
mind
I
am
sure
it
will
find
a
way
out
somehow
it
is
driving
over
a
cow
are
you
taking
elephant
out
or
just
uncoupling
the
the
truck
couple
them
back
together
it
is
the
cow
catcher's
not
worked
very
well
has
it
I
suppose
it
is
caught
the
cow
and
knocked
the
cow
over
oh
no
it
is
got
the
baby
horse
the
bulls
the
bulls
are
lying
down
as_well
here
are
two
bulls
oh
you
want
them
why
are
they
sleeping
and
there
is
the
Mummy
horse
she
is
lying
down
oh
poor
baby
horse
oh
no
oh
no
it
is
run
away
and
the
Mummy
horse
is
running
after
it
picking
the
baby
horse
up
and
she
is
going
to
run
off
with
him
into
the
box
where
it
will
be
safe
but
is
it
safe
or
is
Warren
going
to
get
them
out
oh
no
he
is
getting
them
out
cannot
remember
how
she
did
it
let

horse
down
again
I
think
I
just
did
that
that
was
it
whoops
clear
away
we
have
heard
the
I
think
the
I
think
the
points
must
have
been
stuck
and
he
is
gone
off
into
a
siding
there
is
a
nice
clear
track
here
through
Henry's
tunnel
well
what
if
you
take
the
elephant
out
you
can
put
the
tiger
in
the
truck
lift
the
elephant
out
lift
him
out
put
the
tiger
in
instead
then
you
have
got
the
Mummy
tiger
in
the
trailer
and
you
have
got
the
baby
on
the
sun
will
the
tiger
fit
in
maybe
not
his
tail's
too
long
oh
no
well
it
will
stand
in
it
loose
no
you
cannot
fix
her
in
because
the
tail
sticks
out
this
is
not
designed
for
tigers
it
is
designed
for
elephants
or
horses

I
get
the
tissue
box

the
baby
tiger
inside
the
baby
tiger
can
drive
the
train
is
the
man
going

could
not
it
baby
tiger
back
on

what
is
that
what
color

okay
Warren
push
the
trailer
on
while
Mummy
holds
the
coach
the
truck
no
the
other
way
other
end
you
got
it
right
the
first
time
what
was
that
funny
noise
is
that
your
jumper
under
Warren's
bridge
bridge
and
I
always
thought

kept
orange
juice
and
beer
in
a
fridge
but
there
we
are
trains
stay
in
fridges
do
they
do
trains
go
in
fridges
where
are
those
two
men
going
where
are
they
going
on
the
train
Warren
look
at
it
is
it
the
right
way
up
the
bit
of
tower
in
your
hand
you
were
putting
it
on
the
wrong
way
up
were
not
you
and
is
the
train
staying
under
the
bridge
it
is
getting
a
bit
cold
in
here
have_to
keep
