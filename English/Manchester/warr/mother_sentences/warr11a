the blue
oh that's it
shall I send it back
whoops
now it goes the other way
shall Mummy send it back
with this
Warren count
Warren count again
you did miss it didn't you
you're not a very good shot are you
that's better
whoops
what happened there
okay
there's the thing
if you push the blue thing in in the middle
push the blue button down
it makes it easier
caught it
one two three go
let's see if you can send it under the bridge shall we
let's make a bridge
see if it can go under the bridge
where's the
there they are
just put this across
see if you can send it through the bridge
not quite
shall I move the bridge closer
hooray
straight under the bridge
bridge not fridge
is it a fridge
hey
I've just had a thought what we can do
it did land on the track
I'll move the track then it's got a soft landing
let's put a cushion down
so it has a soft landing
it'll land on your head mate
no
you'll have_to move sweetheart because it'll land on your head and it'll hurt and you'll cry
oh
that missed
no
er sorry no
Mummy didn't miss it
Warren missed it actually
actually
hooray
did it go through the bridge that time
it is sort of
shall I send it through the bridge
did I say bridge
what's happened
no
it'll just
the fire just crash in
are you going to build the bridge again
there's one
there's the other one
that one
Warren put it on
Warren put it on
you hold it again
Warren put it on
that's it
now just leave it like that
brilliant
too late
make a fridge again
okay
it's a very small fridge
you wouldn't fit much in it
shall I send it under the Warren bridge
are you watching
brumm
look at your trousers
you need braces on
we couldn't find your braces though this morning could we
I've got a bumpy track here
with the trains on
we've got three locomotives because it's such a long train
the fire doesn't really go on the track Warren
the fire could go along the side like Bertie_the_Bus does
poor Henry
is he happy
oh yes
they should give you little swapable faces shouldn't they so we can put a sad one on
yes
it is stuck on
all those wheels
pardon
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
how many wheels are there
yes
they are going round and round aren't they
oh no
Henry's tender's gone
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
if he's not got any coal to put in his er firebox
yeah
you put coal in the firebox
to heat the water to make the engine go
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
because engines eat coal don't they
what do they drink
what do engines drink
yeah
Henry has_to have special coal doesn't he
no
your cup's got milk in
and you've just told me that engines only drink water
engines wouldn't work if you gave them milk to drink
there'd be a horrible smell and they wouldn't work
I don't think
you might be able to fit a little car on that one
shall we see if we can find a little car
there's a little truck I think
oh no
it falls off
it's better on that one because that one's flat at the top isn't it
see how that one's flat
that one's curved
that one's not flat
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I think that's probably a bit big
no
the big  definitely too big
I'm not sure if Henry is strong enough
oh yes he is strong enough to pull it
yeah
that breakdown truck goes on best
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
I tell you what we probably could do
we'll put that one on Henry's tender because that's flat
and we could put this one on there but I don't know if Henry'sstrong enough to pull them both
try it
see if Henry is strong enough to pull them
oh if you go very slow
oh dear
oh no
what's happened
what happened
oh no oh no
the little one stays on best doesn't it
except you're driving into a cushion
quick
the fire better come
brumm
it's crashed into the track
quick
over we go
the fire can rescue Henry
in fact what we need
it has
and to clean up the mess we've got the digger and we're going to get every get everything in the digger
whoops
I'm not a very good digger driver am I
and we'll drive over to
shall we take them to Crewe to mend them
here we are at Crewe
there
we can mend those engines
I'll go back and get some more to mend
can you mend those while I'm getting the others
I think Henry'll have_to come last
you mend those other carriages and trucks
I've got Henry's
oh okay
here we are
let's get them mended
poor Henry
what do we need to do to him
we need to check his wheels still move
we need to check they still do this and that
we need to check the magnets still work
yes
is this is this engine all right
can you check these over
check they're working properly
I think they are
hooray
they're working again
shall we put them back on the track
you want them on the floor
okay
brumm
what do you want the digger to do
where's where's the digger going to put them
down where
no
that's all there are I think
I think Henry's such an important engine he really ought_to go in by himself
maybe not
is he going in with that other locomotive
now where are these going
are they going to be dumped on the cushion
to be put on the cushion
move that tender out_of the way
brumm
I think that's the last one
there must be some more carriages somewhere but I don't know where they are
you want to pick up
oh crikey
I've started something here haven't I Warren
now some of these are too big
that's too big and that's too big
and that's too big
most of these vehicles are too big really Warren to be scooped up
only little ones like this can be scooped
or this
whoops
Warren
just move your fingers
right
you do some scooping now then
I think the idea Warren is to pick them up in that shovel really
well if you scoop
right scoop that blue car in
and then we lift this lever up here
that's it
right
to put it down you have_to use this lever here
this yellow one
Warren
what are you trying to do
you're breaking
but they're not trains
they're vehicles
here's the trains
the bricks are too big
well put the bumpy track
oh dear
that cheeky car driving over the trains
what's it doing
poor Henry's going to try and escape
choo
oh no
he's stopped
why has he stopped
because he's got no coal because he hasn't got his tender on
where's his tender
where's Henry's tender
ah
there it is
can you see it over there Warren
by your vehicle box
hooray
yeah
that's Henry's tender
and he needs it because it's got the coal in to feed him so he can go fast because he's stopped
he's run out_of steam because he's got no coal in his firebox
well I don't think we need to look in a book at the moment do we
let's get Henry's tender on
which book
I don't know where Henry's book is
is it
I don't think so
where do you think it might be
I don't know where it is
don't look at me like that with that little old look
I know where it is
I've just seen it
Warren
I know where it is actually
I've just seen it
I remember I did have it last
where is
yeah
Percy's probably stuck on the fridge
yeah
you find Henry
where's Gordon
is he happy
he's not cross there
he's cross there
isn't he
put it flat
oh
Gordon in the ditch
yes
silly Gordon
who's that
rubbish
yeah
you find Henry and the raindrops
it's near the beginning isn't it
very near the beginning
it's one of the very first storys is Henry and the raindrops
oh look
there's Edward
he's been helping Gordon
oh here's Henry and the raindrops
well he's here
Henry and the raindrops is here
are here
there's Henry getting his new coat of paint
who're you looking for
Henry and the raindrops is near the front
there's Henry and the raindrops
and there's Henry without the raindrops
because the rain has stopped
what will Henry what's where's Henry
where is Henry
yeah
yeah
is he happy
so what does he do
does he go in the tunnel
Warren read it
Warren read the story of Henry
Mummy read raindrops again
www
what was the engine called
Henry
is Henry a silly engine
www
the guard blew his
whistle
until he had no more breath
and waved his
until his arms ached
but Henry still stayed in the tunnel and blew
steam at him
yeah
I am not going to spoil my lovely green paint and red stripes for you he said
rudely
www
my doctor has forbidden me to
he said
www
but Henry stayed in the
www
pardon
a joke
is Henry a joke
joke
why is he a joke
are you thinking of Duke
no no no
that's not Duke
that's Henry
Duke is oh
Duke's in an old shed in the mines somewhere
I don't know where Duke comes
