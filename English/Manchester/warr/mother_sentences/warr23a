all these pieces
my_goodness

you can do this by yourself now
do I
well if you say I want to help then I probably do
well those two don't go together
there
that's a help isn't it
well shall we find all the pieces with sky on and put them together
right
let's move the pieces that don't have sky on
that makes it easier doesn't it
right
all these pieces have got sky on
no
no
it doesn't
can you find the other
oh you just have done
yes
you put those on the floor together
no
that's the wrong color blue isn't it
we need a bit of cab roof I think
that's it
no
it doesn't
do you really think so
no
you try and make it flash
oh has the battery run out at last
let's have a look
oh there's a little faint light isn't there
it's not bad though is it
pence pence pence pence pence pence pence pence
oh are you shining it in my eye
well sit rabbit up
oh
what's rabbit been having for lunch
he can sit there
well you put it on his knee just there
put it on his knee
then you can finish your jigsaw puzzle
right
let's sort out this tractor shall we
oh carrots
I don't think you like
yes you do like carrots
you like cooked carrot don't you
right
now then
I'm going to put a piece on for you
there you go
no
that one doesn't go there
what's going to go under that piece
that's it
you've used your brain haven't you
excellent
you're missing lots_of sky
that's right
mm
crunch crunch crunch
when you eat carrots they're cooked aren't they
you don't like raw carrots particularly
you come back and blow on the carrots
to cool them off
what did you do with those carrots this morning at Safeway
you picked them up and put them in the bag for Mummy didn't you
you chose the carrots
well it was just two actually this time
no
I don't think rabbit needs to blow on it
what did you blow on last night
can you remember by the stairs
it moved
a creature with legs
I did didn't I
and what did we sing
yeah
and we did sing wind the bobbin up afterwards
we sang eensie weensie first didn't we
and when we sang the spider moved
didn't it
and you blew on it very gently and it moved as_well
very gently
why don't we finish off the tractor puzzle first
that's right
they're from the same shop
but this one is a big boys puzzle because it's got more pieces than this one
that's only got fifteen pieces
this has got twenty five
shall we finish off the tractor puzzle first
yeah
yeah
we bought that in a shop while you were fast asleep in your push
it was very convenient
because we don't like going in that shop when you're awake because we have_to spend ages in there with you
we can't just whip in and whip out
anyway let's finish off this one
now what's on that piece
a bit of lady and a bit of
yeah
so where's that going to go
yeah
now what's going to go here
no
I think it's just going to be sky
that's right
mhm
now then
we've got two pieces that need to go in
which piece goes where
well try it another way round
look at the blobby sticky out bits
and the little holes that need to be filled
yes but we need to put the last two pieces of sky in first
put these last pieces of sky in first
Warren
that's got two sticking out bits
and that's only got one hole so it can't go there
it has_to go here
work out which way round it goes
that's it
yes
that's right
it's got one sticking out bit which fits into the hole
right
let's get these other pieces out now
well that's so_that you can spread your pieces out
you think so
well why don't you look for the piece that's got a little bit of house on
can you see a piece with a little window on
a little bit of window from the house
remember last time
you put a piece in there and you said oh look
it's got a little bit of window on
can you see a piece with a little bit  window on
excellent
where's the man
that's right
yes
don't they look delicious
do carrots smell nice
I'll remind you of that
hey
don't be rude about my feet
just because I say pooh about your feet doesn't mean you can say it about mine does it
because that's cheeky
no
ouch ouch ouch
bumpy bumpy bumpy
a
is rabbit giving you a cuddle
oh that's nice
yeah
did rabbit give Warren a kiss
good old rabbit
is he going to help you is he going to watch while you do your jigsaw puzzle
rabbit might help
you go and sit over there and rabbit might help
no
he wants to give you that one
tell you what
you give him that one and you have that one
yeah
rabbit's not very accurate is he
he's tired
it's worn him out all this puzzling
no rabbit
you mustn't throw things
naughty rabbit
he is
he threw that piece
you put it in the puzzle
no
it's not very naughty
yeah
he's silly perhaps rather than naughty
silly rabbit
oh isn't rabbit kind helping you with this
are you a kind rabbit
yes
he is a kind rabbit
no
he wants to hold onto this piece and put it in last
just like Little_Bear does
are you sure that's right
other way up
perhaps
oh no
sorry
Mummy got it wrong
silly Mummy
right
try some of the other pieces
