the word is off
not out
like you take your trousers off
can you undo the velcro at the back
hold it at the bottom
that bit there
that's it
you take her dress off
okay
take her arm out
out_of the dress
that's it
hooray
no
I think she wants to keep her pants on
she might get cold with no pants on
what's she going to wear
is she going to wear the blouse and the trousers
is she going to wear these
okay
can you thread her arms in
can you help Mummy
pull it on like that
that's it
now the other arm
thread that in
there we go
now she needs to be at the back
okay
whoops
are you snapping her bottom
oh
do you want her to wear that
right well we'd better take this blouse off then
you want her to wear that as_well
you want that one
okay
thread her legs in
well just let me put the doll's dress on and I'll help you to find the train
oh that's a new one
ahhah
I wonder where the trailer is
truck rather
there it is
no
that's all there is
baby tiger
of course the car can fit in there
I wonder where that baby tiger is
oh there's another car
look
so how many cars are there now Warren
how many cars are there
how many cars are there in the truck
still looking for that baby tiger
it's a man
I can't see the baby tiger Warren
maybe it's in the
there it is
found it
what's Mummy got in her hand
Warren
have a look
choose a hand
I wouldn't fancy sitting in a truck with a baby tiger behind me
now the monkey doesn't sit like that Warren
the monkey has_to stand up
he'll fit on there
he can stand at the front and get smoke in his face
perhaps I'll sit him stand him at the back
there is a man in the cab
that monkey's got a good hold hasn't he
what else shall we put on here
where's the elephant going to go
that's a good place for an elephant isn't it
that one's too big
that one goes he goes the panda goes in his car
in the panda car
is he
why is he sad
who else is going on the trailer with the baby tiger
the giraffe
right
we'll have_to move the baby tiger to the back
then the giraffe can go on the front
she can sort of balance
maybe she can't
if I move the baby tiger back a bit she can sit there
how many
I don't think there is another car
I think you've got enough cars
count them properly
one two three cars
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
the giraffe's head's in the way
what we could do of course
there
now that'll tip back flat
that's better isn't it
I don't know where the other men are
you've got one there
the monkey's sitting on its head
there's another one
I don't think they'll fit sweetheart

no more men
just two
of course you can make a tower
okay
Mummy'll make a tower here
look
there's Mummy's tower
what shall I put on the top of my tower
please
thank_you
well you put it on then
he has hasn't he
put him back in
pardon
penguin on a tower
who's on the tower
who was on the tower
there's another man
and there's one on this coach on this truck
oh yes
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
they have_to go on the top of a tower
what are they talking about
shall I hold this still while you pull him off
there you go
gosh
that's going to be high up
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
they go the other way round
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
men go at the top of towers
not inside them
oh look
there's a penguin on a tower
I'd forgotten about him
pardon
willn't willn't willn't willn't
if you got the green board you could put them on the board
stand him up on it
green board
it's behind you
oh Warren
bless you
try this one
that's it
if you're now trying to get the penguin on I think you're stymied
what are those three men doing
what are they doing
are they singing
or are they making chocolate cakes
that's a very tall man isn't it
he's tall
that's a small one
that's very tall
that's like Paul or Harry or Tom
that's a medium sized one
put it on the floor pet
you'll get a better grip
oh Warren
that's better you see on the floor
you have a better grip
that's it
now the tall man in the middle
so it is
oh gosh
that's exciting isn't it
taking it apart
putting it back together
you why don't you put it on the floor
it's much easier
that's it
how many men
not two
but three
think he'll fit at the front here
it will go on
that's it
that's it
that's not a baby cow
it's a Mummy cow
see if we can find a baby cow
what do you call a baby cow
can you remember
yes
it is the Mummy cow you're knocking over with the train
I don't think there is baby cow
a baby horse
I don't think there's a baby cow
that's a baby horse
a foal
here's another foal
that's a standing up foal
oh there's a goat here
you've been sitting on a goat
shall we put the goat in there with the elephant
here's a bull
it's a Daddy cow
there's the bull and there's the cow
can tell that's a bull because it's got horns
that's a bull and that's a cow
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that's the cow
that's an udder
that's what you get milk from
the special machine that attaches to it squeezes the milk out
and then it's put into bottles and Mike brings it to the house and we drink it
you saw some cows being milked at the farm with Gary didn't you
do you remember
at the stinky farm
seeing the cows being milked with those machines
do you remember
pardon
what
what're you looking at
or what're you doing
Warren
I have a suspicion about that silence child
www
Mummy's going to build a tower now
Mummy's Mummy's making a tower
a strong tower
what is it
tell me what it is
no
it's a goat
look at Mummy's tall tower
it's a tall one isn't it but it's not very stable
I think it might fall over
don't bash it
especially not on your head if that's what you were thinking of doing
no
if you want to break it up break it up on the floor
that's a good boy
Warren can break it up
pull the bricks off
there you see
it's a well built tower that one Warren
you have_to use force to undo it
oh
no
be gentle with them
remember they're not your toys are they
whose toys are they
Anna's toys
you're not to break her toys
she'd have nothing to play with at home
well Warren had better put the train back together then
there's the cab
but you don't know how it goes back together
what's that
do you know what it is
can you remember
cow
right
let's put it back on shall we
right
I think we ought_to put this back together again
I'm not sure how it works or how it goes back together
well make sure you make it like that then
put the blue square behind the cow
put that behind the cow
no
a cabless engine
a boilerless engine
a funnelless engine and a domeless engine
no lights either
that's a bit of a danger
especially as there's no driver
what's gone
well at least we've got a cab
that's right isn't it
that doesn't go there
you've got a bit missing
you've got the funnel missing
this bit needs to go on doesn't it
are you sure
you need a blue square
put that on behind the cow
right no
right next_to it
put it on here
just here
that's it
now the funnel bit goes on top of that
that's it
and the cab goes behind the funnel bit
the cab
there
goes right at the back
that's it
that thing is the coupling where you couple on coaches or trucks
yeah
what a cheeky old dome
I don't know
hiding in the bricks
what're you looking for now
that one does go there
that's it
and where's the driver
well I'm not sure which way round it goes
I don't really think it matters
probably goes that way round
