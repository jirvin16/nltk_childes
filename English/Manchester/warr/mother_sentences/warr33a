oh no
can you empty it out onto the mat
not onto the table
there we go
what're you going to make with this
okay
oh that's pretty
that's good isn't it
are you going to make another butterfly on there now on the top
hey
there we go
I shall make a car in the white stuff
why not
a boat on top of the car
that will be interesting
tell you what we can do
if you turn it that way up
you press it on now
it is isn't it
oh that's not a good idea mixing those two colors together
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you'll just have pink
shall I show you what happens if you mix red with white
look
there's some red
there's some white
I'm just going to mix them up
see what happens
you see the white disappearing and the red is going pink
isn't it
it's changed color
it's not stayed red anymore and it's certainly not white
you see
it's changed color
what're you making
oh
what do you mean do it
we don't really need any more pink
actually if we want pink we've got this pink haven't we
what are you doing
whoops
it's come off
what you need to do is squash it with your fingers like this
squash squash squash
what're you going to make with your pink piece when you've made it
shall we mix
where is that piece that you started making pink
shall we finish it off
mix it in with Mummy's pink
add a bit more white
okay
well we don't want to add too much
because once we've run out_of white that's it
we've run out_of white
we haven't got any more
have we got the wiggly worm maker in here
oh I think we have
I've got half of it
there's the other half
there's some more
a
here they come
want some white ones
put the white in
put it in
that's it
they'll come out pink to start with and then they'll turn white gradually
okay
well make sure you do it over the mat
pink
oh they're starting to come through white now some of them
look
can you see that
that's clever isn't it
there are those wiggly worms pink and white
well do make sure
now you're dropping them on the carpet
do make sure you don't drop things
pick that off my skirt
right
just hang on there a sec
don't move
I'm going to get some
right Warren
before we do any more we're going to move the table
just stop a minute
stop please Warren
because look
you're spraying bits all over
Warren
are you listening
stop
put those down please
right
just leave them for a minute
yes yes
yes
you can do that again in a minute
I'm just putting this down on the carpet
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
okay
now leave it
let Mummy move the table back
right
there we go
okay
you can carry on with what you were doing now
that bit goes in there like that
look at those long worms
they're really long aren't they
are you going to mix them
why are you breaking them
oh right
this is actually quite a good way of mixing colors you know if you keep making them into worms
no
Daddy can answer the phone
move it over the table
shall I help you get it the right way round
that's it
that's it
look at those
can Mummy just have a little play
look at these wiggly wiggly worms
wiggly wiggly worms
do you know what they're like
they're a bit like a horse's tail aren't they
clip
oh you've got it on the floor
good job I put this mat down
we don't normally play with them in here do we
they're getting very pink aren't they those worms
oh no
they're tangled up worms I think now
are they
why are they better
may be what
difficult
yeah
if you put too much in it is hard isn't it
you're being very sensible and careful aren't you
byebye worms
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
look at those
no
they're not
they're good worms those
do you want to try a different shaped worm
we've got some different shapes we can use
instead of lots_of little worms we can make one big worm
we can make a square worm
shall we try making a square one
there we go
whoops
let's pull off these bits of dough here
and put some here
put them in there
where's the rest
okay
you feed those in there then
squash the worms
want to add some pink
some red
that's enough
oh a little bit more
okay
shall we make a big square worm now
are you going to do it
that's a funny shape
can you see how it's square
and it's very long
the whole section is square isn't it
that
we could do a star shape
we could do that star shaped one if you like
have a go at doing the star shaped one
is it
oh yes
hold out your hand
take this one off then
do you want to make the star again
or do you want to make wiggly worms
which shape do you want to make
which is the flower shape
isn't that lovely
it's a good little flower isn't it
can Mummy have a go at making one
no
I'll just use this piece
I'll just use this piece thank_you
no
I just want this one for the moment thank_you
it's your soft stuff after all isn't it
not mine
I like the pink we've made
let's see
oh that's lovely
look
I've made a star
where's your star
are you just peeling it off
this soft stuff falls apart easily doesn't it
it's not like
I have had a good thought
you've had a good thought as_well have you
what's your good thought
oh yes
oh
I don't want that on my nose thank_you
oh no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh yeah
I can't really see

oh you've squashed the eye
okay
oh yes
Daddy's got_to do some work
he was just looking for the window key
all this pink we've made
what is it
it's a flower nose
or is it a nose flower
if it goes on your nose it must smell nice mustn't it
does it smell nice
ugh
that's horrid
that is really horrid
ugh
that's your nose print
now now now
just be gentle with it
course you can sit on my knee
what're you doing
oh I see
I think that bit was too small wasn't it really
you need a bigger bit
that's more like it
no
it's still maybe still not quite big enough
you need quite a big piece to make that car don't you
try not to mix too much white and pink red together
is it
oh right
right
going going going going going going going going
I like making worms
do you
that's right
but I'm making worms
is it
yes
some more of what
some more red
that's all the red there is
the rest is pink
I don't really think we want to make everything pink do we
look at those long worms
shall we mix them up again
oh
it's like spaghetti isn't it
without the tomato sauce
yes well you can't put it in darling because my fingers are there
just get off my knee
I can't do anything with you sat there
yes pet

you're being foolish
I think I'll put the worm maker away
we could cut some shapes couldn't we
right
we'll put these
this isn't very good for cutting out
okay
this play
so I'll put this play away
we'll get out the other stuff shall we
pink and the yellow
because that's good for modeling
because this stuff isn't very good
it's too crumbly isn't it
it keeps falling apart
