no
where are you going to put that
I think it's a bit big for you to carry pet
it's a bit heavy
you just banged your little toe did you
well that's your fault for trying to lift up cement mixers
shall I put it on its wheels
now where are you where did you want to put it
on your knees
well I'm sure you can lift it onto your knees
there you go
is it nice
oh
going going going going going going
or have you got it with your toes
you've got your little toes up haven't you to stop it from falling
no pet
you can see Daddy later
see Daddy later
no
you've got_to come back because Mummy's playing with you sweetheart

whoo
what color
blue pink or yellow
pink
okay
right we'll make some animals then
okay
it goes onto the little mat doesn't it
so it doesn't go on the carpet
right
are you going to roll it out
it's a bit hard
going going going going going going going going
perhaps Mummy can make some
shall I roll it out
it's ever so hard to roll
oh crikey
it's hard
well it will be if I can get this rolled out
crumbs
it's even worse than the other colors
they were bad enough
has Mummy rolled it big enough yet
is it big enough
no
because it's too tough
I think it might be big enough now
right
no
you've got it upside down sweetheart
you need the sharp edge
that's it
it's even hard it cut through as_well isn't it
I think we might try one of the other colors actually
I think the pink is a bit too hard
why don't you put it in the pot
there we go
where are you going to put the plane
they're the propellers aren't they
the propellers
what kind of aeroplane is it
is it an aeroplane carrying people
want to make this person
if we get some more out and then we can make the person
that's supposed to be Granny isn't it
shall Mummy add this to here
and Mummy'll squash it all together and then we can make Granny
not that she looks like either of your Grandmothers does she
right
let's get this squashed
it gets better as it gets warmer
whoops
just a sec
shift
pick up those bits
I haven't rolled it yet
it's hardly big enough because I've not rolled it
mind fingers
they'll get squashed
pardon
do you want to do a bit of rolling
right
well you roll this one out a bit then
okay
then you can cut Granny out
hey
you're good at rolling aren't you
can Granny fit on now
move her up a bit
you need to be strong to do this
okay
now if you peel off the bits and put them in the pot
that's a good boy
well shall Mummy hold Granny and you push Granny out
whoops
her head's stuck isn't it
there she is there look
there's Granny
is she a nice Granny
where are you going to put Granny
where are you going to put her
that's a good place for her isn't it
a
oh you've put her on the picture of the little girl haven't you
right
what're you going to cut out next
that's not a goat
what is it
thank_you
a slight difference between a goat and a kangaroo
you've still not drunk up your hot chocolate have you
shall Mummy do some rolling and then Warren finish off
yeah
where's that aeroplane flying to
is it going to Malta
who's on the plane going to Malta
pardon
cows on the plane
who else is on the plane
going to Malta
is Granny on the plane going to Malta
so she is
she is on the plane
whoo
she's fainted
wake up Granny
going to cut out the kangaroo
is it a bit hard
going to peel off the bits
I think what we need to do tomorrow Warren is to make some play
because this is rubbish really isn't it
not very good
that's a good boy putting all those bits in the pot
you might need the prodding stick to get it out
prodding with your finger
shall Mummy old it while you prod with your finger
now if you prod where his tail is
there we go
is the kangaroo on the plane with Granny
kangaroo on it
whoops
tell you what
we'll put Granny at the front
the kangaroo can go at the back
they are
it's a bit hard to roll you see
that's the problem
because it's some old play
why don't you try rolling it now I've flattened it a bit
because at least you can
okay
if you use both hands on the rolling pin
going going going going going going going going going going
horrendous
that's a good boy picking it up off your trousers
you tried to anyway
well shall
who's going to roll out
Mummy or Warren
mhm yes
silly question really wasn't it
well I hope the van doesn't want to go on the plane to Malta because there isn't space for it
does the van want to go to Malta
good
there you go
whoops
Granny and the kangaroo have fallen over
oh
it's getting close to Malta now
are you going to cut that van out
so what do you want to do about it
hmm
shall we leave it like that
shall we Mummy press
what do you have_to say
of course I will
course I will
it is too hard for Warren isn't it
yeah
you could do it when the play was new
now you peel those bits off and put them in the pot
oh
that's a big piece
does that make it easier to put it in the pot when it's in little pieces
shall Mummy hold it while you prod with your finger or do you want to use the prodding stick
watch it
you'll get your finger stuck in there
there we go
don't squash it
it's taken us ages to roll that and cut it
why do you want to squash it
why
don't you like it
well Warren can roll it out then
no
where's its wheel that you've taken off
is oh there it is
brumm
oh no
it's a wheel without a van
brumm
being
no
it didn't go bang
it went being
there's a great difference between a being and a bang
a bang hurts where as a being doesn't
oh no
the kangaroo's escaped from the plane
boing boing boing
boing boing boing
being
look
Granny's driving the tractor

no
there isn't really a Daddy in there
what's that lady called
no
well
you don't know what she's called
oh
what is it
it is a rhino
you're quite right
a well that's not a rhino is it
because if you look a rhino has got big horn on its nose
what's this one
it's a hippo
oh
Granny's off again
you just sit there Granny
have a rest
no
I don't think so
well I'm not sure that blobs of play like having rides on the back of cars driven by Grannys
well it seems quite happy doesn't it the play
oh yes
where's she going
is she
is she driving to the airport so she can get onto the plane
interesting way of making her legs bend
where's she taking the soft stuff
to Malta
what's the soft stuff going to do in Malta
yes
I know it's going on the plane but what's it going to do when it gets there
is it going to play
where's it going to play
in the what
well of course he can
if you're sitting on that soft stuff Warren
Warren
stand up please
turn round
mhm
you must have knocked it out_of the way just in time
hey
that was clever wasn't it
it bounced
no
you don't kick soft stuff
oh
hello
er no
that's not baby Jesus
that's baby Warren
yeah
where does where does baby Jesus live
he lives in that shed isn't he that Granddad made
yeah
that's baby Warren
no
leave those alone
right
well if you get down I can get them and we can look at them carefully
you've already posted
oh
there was one posted through the fire and Daddy's found it again
there we go
yes
you can take them out if you're careful
and keep them away from the soft stuff
they came from a long long long long way away
and they were a present from Dick and Wendy
yes
what color is his robe
what color is his outfit
yeah
what color is it
well it's just red actually
I I think he fits in that one
do you know what these are
oh he doesn't fit in there does he
they're like little combs
Mummy could comb her fringe
and what's he got
what's that man holding
well I don't think it's baby Jesus but it is a baby
you're right
but if it was baby Jesus what would the man be called carrying him
you can close the box up now
there's a special lock on it
where is it

see if we can lock it
what's in the box
what's in there
some combs
how many combs
you like the number five don't you
that's a good boy
can you unlock it
silly question isn't it
course you can
that's sensible putting it on the floor before you open the box
yes
what are they
pardon
kangaroos
no
they're combs in the shape of men
they're combs
posh funny combs
not combs you're supposed to use on your hair
no
he doesn't fit in there
he fits in there
that's it
that's it
he's fitted
he's fitted
it's a loose fit
yeah
and the man with the baby
goes there
shall we put them back up here so they can have a nice sleep
Warren going to put them back up carefully
oh tipping them all out
oh what is it then
you're opening it to see what it is are you
oh
what a shock
I wasn't expecting three combs that look like men
no
I wasn't expecting that
I thought there was going to be a soft stuff Granny in there
it is locked
hey Warren
I wonder what's in that box
shall we unlock it and look
what's in there
oh
what is it
what are they
they're combs
shall we put them to bed now
okay
