that's a good idea
okay
the panda's bare as_well
he normally has clothes on doesn't he
where's the panda going
is he just driving around for a little drive
I don't know
shall we look for her pants
are you going to put them on her
I hope you put them on her more successfully than you put your own pants on
you fell down the stairs the other day didn't you because you'd got two legs in one leg hole
you got tangled up didn't you
a bit like a mermaid
put the right leg through the right leg hole
like that
the left leg through the left leg hole like that
and then you pull them up
she's got plain white pants hasn't she
you've got some plain white pants as_well
I think you're wearing green ones today
yeah
dolly's got white ones
I think yours are green
yes they are
you've got green ones on
oh yes
there's a hippo in the trailer
there's part of the train
I think somebody's taken the train apart
shall we look for the pieces
and maybe
okay
if that makes you happy
are you moving all these things out_of the way
that's a good idea
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
are you going to tip
right
that's all the pieces out now isn't it
a
there's part of the train as_well
you've got the cab and here's the cow
there we go
where's the driver
hooray
no
he hasn't
you'll have_to find him some coaches
right
are you going to go and find his coaches now
can I just do your shoelace up
Warren
we'll just do up your shoelace
it's a bit short because it broke didn't it
these are very ancient shoes
your feet haven't grown for months and months and months
there you go
it will fit if you just get it in the right position
like there
that's it
a
I see you're getting them the right way round to get coupled
that's very sensible
where's the engine taking the train
where's the hippo going
oh
what are they going to do in Manchester
are they going to go shopping in Manchester
that's a good idea
where did I put your mat
oh it's there
oh right
they're standing in a nice line aren't they
they're being very polite
how many people are there on the train
excellent
okay
I don't think that engine fits on your track Warren
no
well I don't know that it's a good idea having your vehicles out
we could get your mat out couldn't we for the train to go on
your mat's just next_to the box
just next_to the vehicle box on the floor
because we know that that mat's yours don't we
that's right
this is a good mat isn't it for downstairs on the shiny floors
because it doesn't slip
right
and then Anna's train can come on this track can't it
what's the matter
somebody had better open the gate then
okay
those poor people on the train waiting to go to Manchester shopping
never mind
that's right
there's a blue one over there
near the cow
the bull
we saw some pigs the other day didn't we
they were having a shower from the hose pipe
they liked getting the water on their bodys didn't they
it was a hot day
oh I see
you've made a level crossing
aren't you clever
are you clever
no
is somebody going to come and open the gates
well shall Mummy open one and Warren open the other
who is
oh the panda's going to open the gate
now that's a good idea
aren't you kind helping panda
I'll hold that still and you and panda can open the gate
oh panda's
right well what we can do
we'll put the gate on there
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there we go
right
is the train going to drive through now
oh is he
who's going to help him
Warren or Mummy
okay
are you ready
are you ready panda
one two three
right
oh
the train's going to set off isn't it now
come on train
so he is
I don't actually know if the panda stands up
I've never tried actually
oh balancing the panda
hooray
he's not a very good train driver is he if his passengers keep falling out
so what's going to happen to those people that have fallen out_of the train
oh is he going to see if they're all right
oh
why is he
what's he doing then
if you push them down like that
that's it
blow the whistle
you count and then I'll blow
well we'd better get the gate open then
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
shouldn't fall over
that's right
if we have it across like that diagonally it shouldn't fall over
let's just see if it will fall over
see
brill
willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh that might fall over
oh yes it can
put it like that
do you see how it's going diagonally across the square
it just stays upright
shall panda close this one
well they're not going to get to Manchester very quickly are they
all these gates closed
oh that's better isn't it
why poor panda
why was he sad before
he's happy now
was he sad before
right
that's all that matters really isn't it
did you
no
I've never been on a panda either
I don't think you can go on pandas
not real ones
might be able to go on toy pandas
pretend play pandas at the park
do they
you be Fire you were Fireman_Sam earlier on today weren't you
you were squirting us with that belt hose
two what
what's this for
oh
this egg box is getting broken isn't it
no
you didn't break it pet
I don't think
somebody did break it
okay
shall we put the bricks away
shall Mummy put the bricks away while you get the shopping out
okay
it's far more exciting getting shopping out than putting bricks away
are you eating
mm
very tasty
oh yes
how many eggs have you got
which little hole
that'll do
well how many are there there
are there four
count them again properly
one two three
well there are there were four eggs last time
you look in the bag and see if there's another
oh quick
ambulance
can you see it
earth calling Warren
did you see it
oh
yes
when people are poorly they go in ambulances don't they
if people aren't poorly they don't need to go in ambulances
and only very poorly people go in ambulances
because mostly when people are poorly they just go to bed have some medicine and they're all right
but if people are very poorly they go in an ambulance to hospital
don't they
that's right
oh there's a fence
that needs to go in doesn't it
thank_you
