oh I got two back and you got one
one two three whee
oh and I've got all three
oh yes
look at those
I think the digger's outside
no
the digger's outside and wet and dirty
you could put them in the dumper truck
well we'll see but I think it's dirty because we've been digging in the garden with it
oh dear
did you go splashing in puddles yesterday
and what happened when you went splashing in those puddles
what happened
come back over here sweetheart and finish off your drawing
or I'm trying to think what else you could put your crayons in
I think you could probably put some in the tractor trailer you know
right
we just need the yellow bit off the top don't we now
I wonder where that is
here it is
yeah
I'm sure you can fit lots in
if you put them in carefully you'll be able to stack them up
it is
I don't know where the other bit is
mhm
you did didn't you
but that was when you were very little wasn't it
you didn't know then that you weren't supposed to chew crayons
you know now don't you
these all in the trailer
it's a little one isn't it
that one was broken wasn't it
I think you trod on it

mhm
and what's wrapped round the crayon
a bit or paper isn't it
oh yes
is that the same color as the other one
are they the same color
you're right
it is
it is
that's a long green one isn't it
well that's a different crayon
that's a different kind of green isn't it
it is isn't it but it's still got the sharp point on it hasn't it which is good for drawing
well it's not sharp
it's a point
I'm not sure that they'll all fit on actually
some of them might
you'll have_to drive very carefully with all those crayons in the trailer
oh you'd better move those trains before they get run over
oh no
two have fallen off
oh no
what shall we do
oh that was a big rev of the engine wasn't it
oh
why has he stopped
okay
well I wonder where he is
is he in this box
he should be
what's the man who drives the tractor called
do you remember
a
there's the mystery of the missing Henry
he's in the wrong box
and there's a truck a coach there as_well
and there's Henry's tender
I can't find Paf
I've found two jigsaw puzzle pieces as_well
I can't find Paf
well I don't know where Paf is
in here
there's a Paf puzzle
a
who's this right at the bottom
you put Paf in then
oh that's better
if you can fit some more crayons in there's no reason why not
they might but you can try can't you
oh_my_goodness
is he
where's he put the crayons
he's a very busy man isn't he Paf
heaving all these crayons about
the crayons are going to drive
is Paf going to sit in the trailer then
mhm
that's a good place for crayons actually
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there's one more behind you
near your railway box
there it is
gosh
that was a loud engine noise
we'll listen to the music later
you can choose what you listen to
I'm not sure we've got a tape with car noises on
that's because you tipped up the back of the truck
lion's going to bring this one over
and lion's going to stand on the cab
let's move that
there you go
are you going to go under the bridge
oh no
there's one more over there
well I've told you it's dirty
well it'll still be a bit too wet outside
well we'll see shall we
is there
where is it
just gone
oh no it hasn't
it's still there isn't it

oh there he is
just flown away
pop down off that chair
I don't want you to fall
oh are you going to mix all those crayons up
they might
gosh
you're getting a_lot_of exercise in rushing backwards and forwards aren't you
yeah
you nearly did
do you know Warren
I was just going to pull your trousers up and you pulled them up yourself
oh
they are aren't they
fill it
just two more
no
it's not a good idea to bite it
if you if you bite them you can't draw with them can you
mhm
it's a broken green crayon
oh there's a bit of blue on isn't there
that must have been one of the other crayons
don't you
have they been mixed up
