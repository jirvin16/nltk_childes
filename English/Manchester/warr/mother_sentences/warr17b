you've destroyed the train
now is that supposed to go up there Warren
now if you remember the funnel goes in front of the dome
goes like that
what else is in the box
that's a pretty dress she's wearing isn't it
you have_to undo her dress don't you if you want to change her
undo it at the back
then you can take the dress off and you can choose some other clothes for her to wear
it's like pulling you nappie
that's it
no
that one doesn't pull
it just pulls off now
if you unthread her arms
no
other way
when you unthread arms it comes down over the hand doesn't it
like that
okay
there's one
now do the other one
yeah now you pull it down over her hand
that way
that way
that's it
now she has_to step out_of it
that's it
pull it down
that's it
now what's she going to wear
okay
can you thread her arms into it
you don't know
right
well here are her arms
now then look
these are the arm holes here
one here
and one here
can you thread her arms into those arm holes
there's one
can you do the other one
it helps if you start from the inside and go out
there we go
now can you fasten her up at the back
that one goes like that
and that one goes over there like that
that's it
that goes over there like that
she's got tangled hair hasn't she Warren
trousers
I don't think oh she has got trousers hasn't she
do you like this dress
is it a nice one
oy
ahhah
I wondered what that was
I thought it was a bit of a box but it's a turntable
wow
oh
well what do you call a trailer on a train Warren
you don't really call it a trailer do you
what do you call it
you call it a truck if it's on a train
don't kneel on my shins child
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
that's it
hooray
what other things are going to stand up in your truck
what's the giraffe called
Jolly
is that after Jolly tall
the giraffe
right
he's a jolly tall giraffe
that's a good idea
gosh
there's a tower as_well_as a penguin on there
my_goodness
is it
what's in the tanker
oh
oh_my_goodness
where did you see smoke yesterday
it was a chimney
because houses don't have funnels
houses have chimneys
and you looked down and you saw smoke didn't you
what else did you see yesterday
you went on the train last week yes
on Sunday you went on the train didn't you
it wasn't really a special train
wasn't a train like this one though was it
was it it was an electric train wasn't it that you went on
I think the elephant would fit in
there
which man
which man
there are lots_of men
can't see any though
ahhah
whoops
oh now I've destroyed the train
is he going to sit on the elephant
you can make what you like darling one
are you putting a fence round the field so things can't escape
that's the cow
that's the cow's udder
that's where you get milk from
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
in fact you could stand her in already
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
yeah
you want Mummy to make a field
so what do you have_to say
well I think you'd better keep your baby tigers away from here because your baby tigers might get mixed up with Anna's baby tigers mightn't they
you put your baby tigers on here and they can watch
no well if they get put in the box by mistake
let's make the field then shall we
shall we make it a nice big field so the animals have got lots_of space
shall we make the fence a bit higher
yeah
there's a slight problem with this field that Mummy's made
do you know what that is
you can't actually get out_of it
let's have some of these
mhm
we could have a little gate here couldn't we
look
there's a gate so the animals can get out
yeah
if we put that in front we can move that can't we when the animals want to get out
so we've got a cow in the field
what else shall we have in the field
have another cow
how many cows have we got now
that's right
what other animals shall we
shall we put in a horse
how many animals now
no
how many animals all together
no
count them
that's right
three animals
let's put another one in
let's put that bull in
how many animals are there now
you put your baby tiger in if you like
all these animals
my_goodness
lots aren't there
I'm sure it feels safe having baby tigers in with the horses and cows
shall we put let's put the monkey on the side
what's he doing that monkey
mhm
oh that's nice
do you like hugging monkeys
looks as_if the baby tiger's licking him doesn't it
that's what it looks like
the baby tiger doing
is he licking
no
no
good
would you like to be licked by a baby tiger
no
I wouldn't either
well which cream are you going to put on
that's not cream pet
who are you telephoning
who are you telephoning
well you'd better talk to them then
pull the aerial up and talk to them
that's it
they're on now
I can hear them
they're saying hello
say hello
oh
don't keep your finger on it
it's a horrible noise
was it
sounded more like somebody testing the power on their mobile phone to me
but there we go
well you see that has_to go there so_that if the animals want to come out_of the field you can just open it up
and they can come out
and then you can close it again to make sure the other animals don't escape
and they are all standing here looking over
because they want to come out too
oh they're fall they've gone to sleep I think
what've they been drinking
oh no
they're escaping
where are they going
going to hospital
why
what're they going to have done at the hospital
they're going to have lunch at the hospital
that's a good idea isn't it
I expect hospitals do lovely lunches
I've never seen such a thing
have they got_to hospital yet
no
Anna's baby tiger doesn't come off the green bit
see your baby tigers look like Anna's
except Anna's is sitting on a bit of grass and yours isn't
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
no
it's not supposed to come off I don't think
no
it's not supposed to come off
they're just different kinds of baby tigers
oh poor baby tiger
I don't think it's the baby tiger that's being naughty
Warren
bring those baby tigers back please
where are you taking them
no
Warren
Warren
come back
no
you put you come and bring the baby tigers back
there you go
I think if Anna's baby tiger has been naughty you'd better put it back in the box
and if it's your baby tiger that's been naughty you'd better put it back in your box
well shall we put this stuff away first
you're going on
you're going on holiday with your basket
what're you taking with you in your basket
oh

where are you going on holiday
