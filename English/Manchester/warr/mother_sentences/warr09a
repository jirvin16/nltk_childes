has the fire broken down
shall we try and find something to tow it
shall we see if we can tow the fire
I'm not sure that we can
let's try with this shall I
I don't think this will hook on very well actually
no
I don't think we're going to be able to tow it
oh it's just mended by itself has it
let's put it in the garage
there it goes
well we can't hook this this one up pet
it doesn't hook on because can you see underneath
there's nowhere to put the hook
it might go in there but
willn't willn't willn't willn't
yeah
it'll have_to go in the garage
shall we get somebody out to mend it
shall we get somebody out who can mend it
oh she's going to mend it
here she comes
she's going to come in her in her little red car
she's going to come and mend it
fire out_of the garage please
so she can mend it
let's get the fire out
right
she's going to mend it
and she'll turn it on its side so she can look at the engine
there
mended
brumm
nee
right
she pops off in her car
and she's mended it for you
is it mended now
what went bang
is the car going bang
shall we get some more vehicles out
which vehicles shall we get
the truck
I don't know where all your other vehicles are
there's a tractor
that's a bit noisy
here's a breakdown vehicle
can you see
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh
you have_to go very slowly and it doesn't pull along on its wheels but it's kind of pulling it isn't it
not very successful
is she going to drive it
this hooks on best because this is designed to hook on there
but there's noone in it
shall we find somebody to go in the broken down car
a man
there's a policeman
I wonder where the other man is that fits in the cars
here he is

so we've got a policecar and a fire out
nee nee
nee
that's quite right
vehicles drive on the ground on the floor don't they
not on people
poor breakdown truck
it's towing the lorry
whoops
sort of towing the lorry
what's that lorry doing in the fire
can't shut the garage door can we
can't shut the door
I wonder if this'll go in
okay
beep
see
that's just the right size isn't it
let me shut the door
what a clever policeman
he can be a policeman and he can mend fire
my_goodness
what a handy person to have
has he finished mending it
is he going to go back to his policecar
what's on the side of his policecar
what's that
what is it
yeah
that's because he's a star policeman
whoops
that doesn't work well does it
you could try that
see if that'll hook on there
that's not very successful is it
brumm
crazy driver
brumm
are you tired
tired
I don't think that'll work
shall this vehicle tow the policecar
what're you after
I don't think they are
the doors aren't broken
is it
why is it broken
why are the wheels broken
oh the back wheels
I think that's because you've broken the friction movement on it
perhaps we'll have_to get Uncle_Harry or Uncle_Paul to have a look at it
I hadn't realized you'd reached the point where the wheels were broken
the bus is behind you
they're well and truly broken these back wheels
actually if we take this to Sue's today Warren
Tom might be able to mend it
shall we take
or Sue might be able to mend it
shall we take it to Tom's
because we're going to see Tom later
do you think Tom's good at mending cars
I think he probably is
no thank_you
drive it on the floor
with its broken wheels
no
not on my leg
on the floor please
