that is a wobbly tower isn't it
okay
are you going to make it
what what color
what color do you want
or is it the shape you're after
you could use that big green arch couldn't you
mhm
they're a bit far apart aren't they those two
oh that's good
if you put that across there you can put some more on top can't you and make it taller
you could use these
these ones are quite good
if you put those put those on top like that
put those up like that and put this yellow arch on
oh it's going to fall
oh dear
it's a bit wobbly on this rug isn't it
not on the floor
okay
let's get it started shall we
oh
I thought you wanted to make it on the floor so it didn't wobble as much
hooray
course you can
that one's clever isn't it
slotting over the top like that
you're making it very high aren't you
oh
oh look
that one stayed in
oh
it's just fallen out again
you're making another tower
that's a good idea
is that funny
well it doesn't really matter
bits of grass get everywhere don't they in here
that's a good boy
are you a good boy
are you good
no
you're not a good boy
I think you're a good boy getting all the bits of grass off
look at that
well done
okay
I'm just wondering if you put that there you could roll it
it doesn't work
you can roll that one like that
you can't really roll it on the floor like a wheel
it doesn't work that way
it does wobble doesn't it
are you making a wobbly tower
who makes a wobbly tower
that's right
he does doesn't he
does Wibbly_pig's tower fall over
he does
who else makes a mess
ow
that wobbly tower landed on my feet
poor Mummy
Mummy's going to build another tower
oy
that wasn't very kind
poor Mummy
trying to build a beautiful tower and you just knock it down
yes well I don't want it going on there
this is Mummy's tower
you can build your own tower and do what you like
no darling
this is Mummy's tower please
can you pass that long yellow one
your long yellow that big yellow block
no
that's not big and it's not yellow
no
that's red
the yellow one at the back
that one
yes
pass it please
thank_you
get it balanced
put that big yellow one on
oh
that wasn't very kind
what a meanie boy
well you can make what you like dear but I shall probably just knock it down shalln't I
that's what you did with Mummy's
is that a tree
I tell you what you could do
that's a very funny place to put them up your t
oh right
oh_my_goodness
I don't think I'd call it a hat as such
you're a wrecker you are
you're always wrecking the things that I make
wobble wobble wobble
wobble wobble wobble
wobble wobble
there
Mummy broke it before you could
wobble wobble
it's a very funny tree
apart from the fact that it's blue and red
those two are the same color aren't they
that's red and that's red
and what color's that one
yeah
you can make whatever you like darling
oh no
look at that
it is a mess isn't it
you're just like Wibbly_pig
put that one on my head
the red one with the hole in the middle
oh you just bashed me with your knee
no
I don't know if I want another one on my head
what color is it
what shape is it
ow
no
you must be gentle
poor Mummy
Warren
that wasn't green
that was blue
wasn't it
it was blue
uhoh
what's in there
teeth marks
some baby's been chewing this
a baby boy called Warren
no look
Warren's teeth marks
don't bite it again
no
you can't
it's too strong
it's too strong
pardon
you want Charlie to talk
well you'll talk to Charlie next week on holiday
no
you can't talk to

oh that's a good noise
nice and quiet
oh
that was loud
it was very loud
well you should be more careful then shouldn't you
what
you want to take the label off
shall Mummy give you a hand
if you want Mummy to do it let Mummy do it
oh it's going to come off in pieces
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh maybe it will come off in one big piece
oh
maybe not
what shall we do with this sticker when we've taken it off
stick it on Warren's nose
you could put it in the bin if you like
that's a good idea
hey ho
we don't want it stuck on there
it's in the bin now
oh you be gentle with that table
okay
let's see how you make the plane
do you want that piece for the fuselage
right
what kind of plane is it
have you got people on it
got a block on it
okay
with that with that on it looks a bit like a jumbo jet with the dome on doesn't it
there's your wings
shall we get a tail plane on
come on
let's put the wings a bit further back up there
there we go
there we go
there's your plane
is that where it's going
what will the people on the plane do when they get to Malta
you went to Malta a few weeks ago didn't you
no
you're not
you're going to Devon
but you don't like swimming darling
you cry when you go to the swimming pool
don't you

Irene just puts cold water in her paddling pool
it was a bit cold wasn't it
it was even too cold for Mummy
she did didn't she
did Gary spray Warren
and what did Warren do
what did Warren do when Gary sprayed him
what did you do

and Warren had a hat on as_well
and you played with guns and swords didn't you
and knives
did you
oh dear
that's a very long body on that plane isn't it
have you got two engines on each wing
that's a good idea
that means it can go further doesn't it
that's right
just two engines on the wings
how many engines are on that wing now
that's right
well there's another one over here
there are
is that last one blue
