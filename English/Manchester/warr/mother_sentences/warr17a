well you just stay in there and make Anna another cup of tea while I go and look for the other puzzle
was this the puzzle you were after
the fish puzzle
in the squashed box
right okay
let's get the pieces
turn them the right way up
you turn some the right way up
turn that one the right way please
right
where are you going to start
oh
well that's fair enough
right
here's half of the sun
can you find the other half
right
if you fix those two together then
well you just have_to do it gently and accurately
there you go
right
now then
what else are we looking for
um can you see a little
oh no
I can't really describe that
no
a boat goes here
can you see a boat
that little green bit is a little bit of the green sail
that's it
you've done all the top of the jigsaw
right
now then
here there's a little bit of a turtle
can you see the rest of the turtle
that isn't that one
can you see a turtle
like a tortoise
it's also got the mermaid's hair on it
her long golden hair
can you see somebody's hair
with a turtle a tortoise at the top
where's the mermaid's hair
it's this little bit you're looking for here
can you see some pieces that look like that
come and look at the pieces
no
it's not got the starfish on
yes
you're looking for one of those
can you see one of those
Warren
no no
that's right there
you leave that there
no
but it will be when you've finished
can you see one of those
yeah
there's one here
can you see one on the pieces
what about that
is that it
and that goes there
it is big enough if you are accurate child
there we go
now can you see the mermaid's eye
and there's also the legs of an octopus
orange legs
and she's holding a starfish in her hands
hmm
can you see a starfish in somebody's hands
that's right
and it's got her face on
it goes in there
that's it
brilliant
now then
the mermaid
she's the mermaid
mermaids are very special
they've got instead of legs
yeah
you're looking for that bit there
and she's got a tail like a fish
don't be daft
she's got a tail like a fish
yeah
it does
that's the mermaid's tail
like a fish
right
let's see what else we can see
oh yes
so it does
now then
what goes here do you think
no
no look
that's got a straight side there
that must go at the bottom or at the side
I think that's the back of the fish
can you see a big fish's face
a big fish's face
a big green fish
yeah
excellent
I think we're missing some pieces of this
oh no
there's still that one there
right
where's the fish's tail
have a look
we're looking for this bit here with that piece of seaweed as_well
can you see a piece with that pale green seaweed on
yeah
we're looking for that one as_well
we're looking for the fish's tail and the green seaweed
let's have a look at the pieces we've got
er what is that
what's that
that's it
so we've got two pieces left
where do they go
excellent
brilliant
wow
aren't you clever
and what can you see on this picture
what is there
well you tell me
what is it
it's a big fish
bless you
oh Warren
I don't think you actually needed to do that did you
yes you did did you
makes you feel better does it
where are the starfish
where are the yellow starfish
here they are
how many starfish are there
ba da
is this a new language
wa da
how many starfish
oh
what are they
turtles
not vehicles
turtles
one two turtles
two starfish
one two
do you know what that is
it was in your a book
it's an anchor
er you be careful
you might bash your head on something
like my arm or the corner of that table
what are you doing
help
darling
you're the one who climbed up
no
there isn't a horse here
whoops
there isn't a horse here
go on that horse
do you mean go on Mummy
going going going going going going going going
because you'll fall off and hurt yourself
no
I'm not having you pumpy pumpy pumpying
whatever pumpy pumpy pumpying is
I'm worn out
your dumper truck's here Warren
but I think before you get your dumper truck out you ought_to put your tea set away because you might damage it
I know where you could put your tea set
actually you could put it in your dumper truck
get it out from the garage
don't throw them in
put them in gently
put them in gently
oh are we keeping you up
no
don't
look
you're not being gentle with this
you have_to put it on and make sure it's right before you start leaning on it
where is the garage
is it just over there
I don't think it's gone anywhere
no no no
you stay here Warren
there isn't a garage
Warren
shut the door please
shut the door
garage
garage
come back
Warren
there's no garage out here
come on
the garage is upstairs
well it's not a garage anyway
it's baby Jesus's shed
I know you think it's a garage but it's not
it's a shed where baby Jesus was born
I know you think it's a garage but it's not
what're you doing
that's a good idea isn't it
right
just let Mummy put the box like that
what a clever boy
are you going to tip some more into the box
don't put the baby tiger in
brilliant
it's probably easier to just put it straight in the box but not as much fun is it
right
let's get the box lined up shall we
would you like to drive a tipper truck when you're grown up
now is there any more of your tea set that needs to go in the box
can you put the rest of your tea set away please
why don't you put the other knife and saucer in
oh there's another knife there as_well
a blue knife
um I'm not sure that's a good idea
it's supposed to be able to withstand an elephant standing on it so it might be able to cope with you
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you can sit on it I suppose
well the thing is you see you might fall off it and hurt yourself
or you might fall backwards into this and get your bottom wedged in the dumper truck in the dumper bit
and then you wouldn't be able to move
you'd have_to spend the rest of your life with a dumper truck wedged round your bottom
and then you'd look silly
well yes
you have_to put the rubble in before you can tip it out though don't you
mhm
it doesn't really look like rubble to me
that looks more like a minicar
shall I put this away
gosh
that dumper truck's acting like a snowplow isn't it
why
well don't
no
don't drive over things with your dumper truck because that  how things get broken
I know your tea set's only plastic but that's beside the point
very gentle
the thing is you can't scoop with the dumper truck can you
you can only dump things with it
you could always
your digger might be able to scoop
well your digger's up there
why don't you try scooping with your digger
on the top box
no
your digger's not in that box
your digger's not in the vehicle box
it's in the big box
there it is
whoops
you've been picking your labels off these haven't you
oh you've scooped up a cup
where are you going to put it
okay
and where's the garage
that's it
I'm not sure whether that'll be very good at picking up big things
that's good for little things
why don't you try putting some more cutlery in as_well
perhaps a couple of spoons as_well_as the fork
