right
I want a
there's a bumpy road
oh thank_you sweetheart
I shall make this bumpy road a bit longer
well that's rather an inconvenient shaped piece to put in actually
there you go
one bumpy road
we'll leave those pieces out
we don't need those in at the moment
or is that going to cause great traumas
ah ah
put this one up here
is that better with all the pieces in
I'll build
er Warren
the train is supposed to go on the track
shall we put some carriages together
how many how many carriages shall we put on
just keep it in the track
it's much easier
says she now derailing it
reverse
beep
is it stuck back on
oh
you don't need to push it from the back
if you pull it from the front
that's it
oh the train's getting longer
brilliant
shall we make a tunnel
do you want a tunnel
we could make Henry's tunnel
right
let's get some bricks out to make Henry's tunnel
I thought we
I thought we were making Henry's tunnel pet
here's Henry's tunnel
the problem is you see
we haven't got enough track to do two two tracks so this train's going to get stuck in Henry's tunnel
it goes round
he'll get into Henry's tunnel
and he can't come out
oh no oh no
oh yes it can
never mind
we can make that a decoration for the top of the tunnel
hey
we could pretend it was a train with a snowplow on the front
that looks like a snowplow doesn't it
oh
that's an alternative use of my tunnel
see
we'll put the the bits across the top
the bigger bits
no
that bit's not going on there
these bits across
well I've never seen a carriage pulling a train before
no
it can't go in because Henry's tunnel's got a wall built across it
hasn't it
you could always move the wall from the front
you could always move the wall
the wrong wheels
no
they're the right wheels
er
I think you've lost some of your coaches
Warren
yeah
you did bash Henry's tunnel
why did you sound surprised
Warren build Henry's tunnel
I don't see why I should keep building a tunnel if you just keep bashing it down
Warren make it
let's put those two close together then you can make Henry's
no
put it the other way round
no
put it long put it crossways like that
that one can go up there yes
is that a decoration for Henry's tunnel
well this is going to be a wild tunnel isn't it
don't push them all under the chair because we might not be able to get them out
and you've pushed one of the best
pardon
well I'll see what I can do
no
don't bang
don't shove them under any more
it's amazing what we find under these isn't it
there's one
no
don't keep pushing them back under
if you push them back under again I'm not getting them out again
I don't mind getting them out once
I can't reach any more
I'll make Henry's tunnel
mind the cups of tea pet
shall we make a fancy tunnel
make a fancy tunnel
where are you going
Daddy's gone out
oh your nose is disgusting child
Daddy's gone out
oh gross
you just whip your fingers in there and it's horrible
horrible
have you seen that fancy tunnel
with all those fancy bricks on it
look
well it does look a bit like a castle
would you like Mummy to build a tunnel
mhm
I'm not quite sure how you build a castle
oh
that train is really a bit too long
I don't think there are any coaches missing
count them
you missed out this
well that's not a coach is it
that's an engine
you've got two engines and four coaches and that's how many you should have
oh there it is
air two thousand possible
it was a white plane with a red
it's just gone
let's have a look
no
it's just gone behind those trees
just missed it
never mind
there'll probably be another one soon
people going off to see the sunshine
well that was a big one
it wasn't a little one
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
there might be
there might be a big one coming
Warren
you've got a crushed cardboard box
it's not that exciting
you go and tell Anna in a proper voice why you're so excited
Henry is flavor of the month isn't he Warren
what happened to Henry Warren
what did Henry do
what did Henry do
he went in a tunnel didn't he
he went in a tunnel and did he come out
why not
he didn't come out because he didn't want to
he didn't want the rain on his nice clean engine
now I've destroyed the tunnel
look at that tunnel
look what Mummy's demolished
oh dear oh dear
good job the train was out isn't it
otherwise there would have been a nasty accident
right let's put this
get the tunnel rebuilt in time for the train when it comes past
oh
that's funny because it stood on the other ones

you've really got too many coaches
Warren
if you have three coaches
oh sorry
one engine and two coaches
that's just the right just right
we can have two trains on here
Mummy's train and Warren's train
oh
there's Warren's train coming out_of the tunnel
beep
move your train
move
oh the train's going to crash
sweetheart
you'll hurt your hand
don't be so vicious
pardon
the train's come off
has it
why
oh dear
oh dear dear
you do some bashings then
what
well I'm not sure that your finger's strong enough
Warren
we run vans on the
what's the word
floor
on the floor
on the floor
now have you finished playing with your track and your bricks
shall we put them away
shall we put your bricks and your track away
well they're in the way really
if you're going to play with your vehicles
because your vehicles don't fit on the track
do they
no
that's too big
they're either too big or too small
well you see these engines and carriages are just the right size
what have you done
shall Mummy mend it
how are you doing mending it
have you done it
have you mended it yet
you've got that bit in the wrong way round
do you want Mummy to do it
no
that's the wrong way round
bring it over when you're completely stuck
you need the blue bit inside sweetheart
that's the black bit that goes at the bottom
you need the blue bit that goes inside
the blue see bit
this bit goes inside like that
no
I need the wheels
thank_you
you put the wheels on there
here we go
but these vehicles don't fit on here
they're they're not the right size are they
that's too big
no
that's too big
if you want to drive vehicles you have_to drive them on your track
on your mat
track mat
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
in fact the tractor will get jammed because
oh look
the tractor can pull the caravan
well just lift
that's it
can you do it
that's it
no
the tractor can't tow them because there's no magnet on it
what're you doing
why aren't they on the track
are they special trains that can go on roads and on tracks as_well
that's where it crosses over when we do a figure of eight
what're you after
no
no
none of them fit
they're all the wrong size
it's not even got wheels
there you are
see if this can fit
no
it can't can it
what does fit on the track will
what does fit on it
the train fits it
look
that's a perfect fit
isn't that amazing
well move the vehicle then
move the vehicle then
sorry
er no
no
Warren
come here
make Henry's tunnel again
yes
things don't get done unless you say please do they
hmm
make Henry's tunnel
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
it's too big
Warren
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
because Henry's tunnel is for Henry
it's not for Terrence the tractor
oh that's not even Terrence the tractor anyway
that's just an ordinary tractor with wheels because Terrence has caterpillar tracks doesn't he
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
the trains will fit in the tunnel because that's what the tunnel's for
don't bash them
you'll break them
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
no
don't bash them
you'll break the magnets
well let's build a tunnel quickly
oh
who's underneath the blanket
all the girls and boys
have you left any truck carriages in the tunnel
have you left anything in the tunnel
good
