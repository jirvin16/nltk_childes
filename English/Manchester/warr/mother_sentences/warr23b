she is isn't she
well you look for her pants
shall we stand her up there and she can wait for her pants
you find her pants
a
right
shall I hold the doll while you put her pants on
mhm
you're no more accurate putting those on than you are putting yours on are you
thread her legs in
oh
through the leg holes
right
are you going to pull them up
there
that's better isn't it
it will
shall we find her something to wear now
right
is she going to wear anything under the trousers or just the trousers
just the trousers
it is quite warm today isn't it
is she
no
I don't think she is
I think she might help you with your shopping
whose whose car is that
is it
well the tiger had better jump in it and drive it otherwise somebody might pinch it
but the panda's pinched it
brumm
is the tiger going to come running after to try to get his car back
oh dear
well I hope the panda's not going to come driving back very fast
brumm
screech to a halt
beep
beep
well I hope he does
brumm
that's the best place for a giraffe to be isn't it on the pavement
what's he going past
it has
I don't know
right
well you look for the train
um not sure that it is
okay
what a lovely noise
oh yes
now see if you can find any more bits of train
let's come and have a look
that's all the bits out now
can you see the cab
I can
is it a crash helmet for the panda
crazy driver
needs a crash helmet
brumm
shall the crazy driver come back
oh he ran over your fingers
that's a dangerous driver isn't it
not just crazy
a
what's that
well that
why don't you bring it over here and I can have a look
or shall I go over there
shall I come over here
let's have a look
not quite
now then
do you want a very tall train
because this is going to be a very tall train at the moment
let's just sort it out
then we can have a tall train
look at that tall train
chuff
right
brumm
that's a very tall train isn't it
no
I think the car's on the track
that car had better move
brumm
crazy driver
I think that train driver's a crazy driver a well
don't you
oh dear
don't think so
no
going to make a tunnel
poop
oh no
there's been a train crash
is it
well panda cars
that's what you call police cars
the train's had a crash

he needs a kiss
oh naughty rabbit didn't put his hand in front of his mouth
that's it
that's a good boy
you're saying ouch
I think I'll get out_of the train's way on this chair
don't like being run over by trains
that's a good idea
because a locomotive is very big isn't it
it's tall
you can have a tall tower on the back
is it tall enough now
that's a nice tower isn't it
very fancy shape
is it tall enough yet
it did didn't it
oh no
what a disaster
that's better
that's a stronger tower isn't it
you certainly are
oh
you did didn't you
oh right
I'm sorry
does Warren not go crash
a
you've got only got one blue brick on your tower haven't you
right at the bottom
oh no
it's fallen off again
that wasn't entirely successful was it Warren
shall I show you a good way to make it stronger
if you get this big brick
put it right across there
that'll help to make it stronger
and then the whole thing fell apart rather than just one brick
oh well
thing is Warren
if you try pushing bits on the sticky out bits it will fall apart
if you stick them on the main bit of the tower
oh dear
pardon
you want to throw a tissue
no
you can't
hey ho
I don't know
you threw it mate
that's the problem with throwing things
you don't always know where they go
no
throw a piece again and they all go away and they go straight back in Anna's car
yes
right
let's put them away then
oh
how strange
I thought you said I don't want these
are you building a fence
are the cows going in the field
where's the gate going to go
right
it's quite big
is it
if you say it's only little darling it's only little
that bit's sticking out isn't it
what color's the piece that's sticking out
what about the other piece that's sticking out
yeah
a
another tall tower
what do you think I'm doing
making what
making the car ridge
carriage do you mean
pardon
a bridge
well I wasn't going to make a bridge no
would you like me to make a bridge
this is special going to be a special bridge
yes well I don't and this is my bridge
no
it's not
it's my bridge actually
you can make a bridge yeah
no problem
I think the train could probably fit through it
you're right
you know what his bridge is called
it's called baby tiger bridge
there
will it fit
no
Mummy'll just make the bridge a bit taller then
making the bridge taller
mhm
I noticed
why are you moving them
Warren
Warren
why are you moving all those bricks
so there's space for the baby tiger bridge
oh
what would you like
a banana bridge
shall we try and make it wide enough for the car
can you pass me the board that's got lots_of big pieces on
can you pass me the flat board with big pieces on
here
the board with big pieces on
this one
right
make it wider so_that the car will fit through shall we
making it wider so the car will fit through
this will make it a bit taller as_well
what color pieces am I putting on now
oh hang on
oh dear
there we go
will that fit through now
whoops
oh no
one of the legs has fallen off
there we go
that's a very big bridge isn't it
who is
cars shouldn't really go on pavements should they
oh yes
two wheels on the pavement and two wheels on the road
where is it going to go
oh
is it pinching the car
brumm
brumm
hey
I thought we'd just said that cars shouldn't go on pavements really
oh yes
where's he going
a
what can he buy at the shops
what kind of food
pardon
oh we'd better be very quiet then hadn't we if he's asleep
wake him up
what was that waking him up
was it
it wasn't a very quiet lion
it was a very noisy lion
this bridge keeps getting taller
it's now a banana fish bridge look
is he
oh yes
a whole car's on the pavement
well that shouldn't be allowed should it
how many
three
that's right
are they on the pavement too
have_to make sure that car doesn't bump into them
I don't think those men should move because cars shouldn't be on pavements
yes
bless you
bless you
send it back
send it back under the bridge
oh no
it's banged into the bridge
I'd like to see you aim him accurately at speed to the bridge sweetheart
oh no
he's on the pavement
