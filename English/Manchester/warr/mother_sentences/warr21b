what're they talking about
are they talking about all the animals they can see
what can you hear

I've no idea where it is
it was a bee or a wasp or a fly or something
well no
it wasn't a butterfly because butterflys don't make buzzy noises
butterflys are very quiet
it might have been a fly
it might even if it was a bee it might have been outside
because bees sometimes buzz so loud that you can hear them through the window if they're very close
it might have been that wasp that we saw the other day in the bed
it escaped
very beautiful
wobble wobble
wobble wobble
poor Mummy

even then you have_to be very careful about how you break them
you have_to bash them with a knife
oh don't break the eggs
it'll make a mess on the carpet
oh
well there did used there were lots more eggs at one point
I think somebody's been making omelettes with Anna's eggs
okay
right
that's a good place isn't it
shall we put the lid on
stop them falling out
put them carefully in the basket
there we go
is it
it's all those cans of food you've got
have_to do some of your own home cooking instead mate
oh nice refreshing ice
no
you take that out_of your mouth
you're not really a baby anymore are you
why aren't you a baby
what do babys wear
babys wear nappies
and put things in their mouths
do you wear nappies
no
you don't
you'd like a cup
um shall we get a cup out_of your tea set
you can pour the milk into it
but we must remember it's your cup and not Anna's cup
she doesn't take it home with her

it's a special milk bottle
that's it
oh delicious

so_that when Anna gets these out at home to play with and she  surprised
she'll open the egg box and she'll think oh I'll play with some eggs
and she'll open it and she'll say oh
but what are these doing in here
is that a good idea
shall we leave those in there
maybe some other children might be surprised as_well when they see strange things in there
what's this doing in the fruit in the shopping basket
where should it be
oh here
