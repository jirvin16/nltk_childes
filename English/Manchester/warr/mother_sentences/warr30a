they're broken
no
Granddad's very clever at mending things but he can't mend the tyres
no
these are broken tyres now
they can't be mended
look at that one
there's only one tyre on the car that's all right
no
that one's broken
that one's broken
and that one's broken
that one's very broken
no
don't do that
you'll spoil them
the poor car with broken tyres
has it
yeah
no
it isn't
that's because you can't break it
that's the only reason why
well it still runs doesn't it
it just probably perhaps can't go very fast
oh look at that tyre
it's a bit heavy for this breakdown isn't it
it's too heavy
shall we build a fence on this lego
that one is broken isn't it
I wonder if we can see the other part of it
you see it might have broken a long time ago and Daddy threw it out
I can't get this
oh yes I can
look
what's this
a little flag isn't it
that's good that because it sticks onto the lego
look
they are hard
your little lego's easier to use isn't it
well you've got some of your bricks here
Nana's gone
yeah
she's gone to do some housework
I think
or she's going to sit with her feet up
oh that sticks onto the little lego
now that's handy
now that's a very tall neck isn't it
yeah
now Mummy's going to do an experiment with these
oh
look at that
what are you making
a snow car
wow
you probably can yeah
you can make whatever you like dear
if you want to make a snow car you make a snow car
look
arms
legs and feet and a body
put a baseball hat on it
whoops
have I knocked its arm off
never mind
you don't have wheels on your head
he's a one armed creature
oh
legs have dropped off
never mind
look at that
oh
oh
there's one foot
where's the other foot
where's and there's his leg
well that's a funny arrangement of legs and feet
what kind of vehicle
are you still making the snow vehicle
you can't
why not
why can't you make the snow vehicle
hey
that's my foot
pooh
well I can pooh your feet mate
pooh old feet
no
I don't think you want to smell Anna's feet
I don't think she's into foot smelling
well I want doesn't get darling as your Grandma and Nana always say
that's a whinie little voice
oh
snap snap
what's in this sock
what is it
is it little bits of cheese
a
what is it
it's lego is it
what's lego doing in your sock
is it
shall we have a cheese buttie
shall I tip it out
see what it is
where shall I tip it
look at all those bits of lego
is that tasty
it would hurt if you put your sock on wouldn't it
it certainly is
whoops
well I hope it doesn't break
think it will
oh no
don't chew
I think this bulldozer's going to er tidy up your lego
where shall it put it
oh I'll put it in this car
goes back to pick some more up
oh
look at all these roofing tiles
I've not seen these for years
what you do is you kind of fit them together and you can make little roofs for houses
make little lego houses and put roofs on
yes
no
it's quite difficult making houses out_of lego
because you need to remember things like doors and windows
I always used to forget those
here's a little house
some bits of roof missing
I wonder if we can find those missing pieces
for the roof
this is a different kind of roof this is
no
it can't fit in
you're quite right
oh
I wonder where those missing pieces might be
whoops
is that one right
no
silly Mummy
is it
okay
let's let's just pull it apart a bit
let's pull the red ones off
mhm
I'm not convinced
oh no
now Mummy's wrecking the hole thing
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
oh no oh no
poor Mummy will get into trouble if I've broken it
what
you try putting it there then
from the back like that
yes
now we're a bit another bit missing here
a little red bit missing
I wonder where that might be
oh hang on
hang on
hang on
let's just wreck this again
oh no
oh no oh no
silly old Mummy
is Mummy silly
oh
is Mummy sensible
a
hey ho
Warren
look
can you put that back please
I'm trying to mend it
why are you breaking it apart
oh it's all broken
all broken
oh
doesn't don't you want a door in your house
that's a door look
well how are people going to get in and out if there's no door
yes but darling if there's no door how are they going to get in and out
through the window
what a funny boy
in and out through the window
why is the bonnet up on that mini
let's have a look
you show me the mini car
why is the bonnet up
oh it's got a piece of lego in the engine
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
no
little pieces will fit in
little pieces like these will fit in
shall we see how many pieces we can fit it
whoops
look at all those pieces
are they all out
that one's driving is it
has it
let's have a look
no
I think it's just the axle's jammed
this one hasn't worked for a long time has it
perhaps tomorrow you might be able to choose another vehicle like that
do you think along with a book
no
the wheels can't be mended
no
they can't I'm afraid
Mummy's tried and Granddad's tried
and we've both failed
and if Mummy can't do it and Granddad can't do it then there  no chance for anyone doing it
no
the wheels just don't go round
that's the problem
well I think I think the car needs to go to the garage really doesn't it
for somebody to mend it
perhaps we should have taken it to the garage this morning with Mummy's car
well yes
Daddy's and Mummy's
Mummy's at the moment because Mummy's driving it
but I'm not driving it am I
Derek's driving it
that man is driving it
he probably is
it is and it's broken really
yes it is
what color is it
what color is your car
green
rubbish
what's this
what color's this
it's not called green
it's called white
and what color's this
it's like Mummy and Daddy's car isn't it
what color is it
it's izzy whizzy let's get busy
that's a funny color
it's black
with a white roof
those are green aren't they
no
it's not
that's right
and what color's the roof
well it's green now because you're putting the tiles on it yes
what color's your t
well it is where you've put the tile
what color's the dog
yes
what color's the dog if there's no tile
is it
that's probably because you're jabbing lego bricks into it
oh don't
that'll hurt
strange child
how many bricks have you got in there
yeah
not very good at balancing is it
shall we try and balance the roof on your leg
there you go
oh dear
shall we try balancing this road sign on your knee
hold your knee very still
oh
that wasn't much good was it
try that way
a
propped up now isn't it
well I hope the car does go stop otherwise he'd bash the engine wouldn't he
the front in
well it's not really a very good idea for cars to crash
that's why they have brakes
yes they do
but it's not nice if they do
oh dear oh dear
had the ambulance better come
and the policecar
oh who's on the phone
it's for you
no
it's for you
oh
have they hung up
oh is it
who is it
who did you phone
is Charlie on the phone
where is Charlie
well that's because you're not really supposed to get round
you'll decapitate yourself
why are you crawling round there
are you going to be up to wickedness
are you doing wicked things round there
oh Warren
who are you talking to
are you peeping
I can just see your tufty hair sticking up
you need a hair don't you
who is
Matt
no
Matt isn't going to cut it
well Matt does cut long hair but he does cut short hair as_well
it's just that Mummy hasn't got Matt's phone number so she can't get him to come here
we'll take you to Dean's hair shop tomorrow
and near Dean's shop there is a bookshop
because we're going to buy you a book tomorrow I think aren't we
why are we going to buy you a book
that's your fault for kicking Anna's foot mate
why are we going to buy you a book tomorrow
no
why are we going to get you a book
is it because you're a big boy
yeah
there was wasn't there
a
what's that
a brick
a right
I thought it was something more sinister
why are we going to buy you a book tomorrow
can you remember
can you remember
do you remember
why are you getting smily faces on a chart
can you remember
no
don't break it apart
no no no
Mummy was trying to mend it
oh
you don't want it mended
right
they're hard to get apart aren't they these little legos
oh look
you pulled one of the windows out
are you mending it or just destroying it
destroying it
okay
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
if you want it mended
you don't
okay
all right
okay
that's all right
are you going to make something else with the bricks
or are you just going to put them in your sock
okay
it is hard
that's why this lego really is for big boys
not for little ones
you're quite a big boy though aren't you
I'm not sure that I actually want lego
no no no no
Warren
I don't really want lego in my shirt
it's rather uncomfortable
you terror
what do you mean hey
you put it down mine and I can put it down yours
it did didn't it
oh no
take that out_of your mouth
you don't put lego in your mouth
there's a pair of wheels
oh no
they're driving up your back
over your head and across your cheek and your mouth
down your chest
across your arm
down your leg
Mummy's legs
and away
have you got some other wheels in there
