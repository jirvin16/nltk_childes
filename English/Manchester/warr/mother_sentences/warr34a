probably keep sneaking more mouthfuls in when I'm not looking
we went to Devon didn't we
no
where did we go
no
that was the last holiday
we went to Barnstaple
you keep saying that we're going back to Barnstaple don't you
you sit on the little toy train and say I'm going to Barnstaple
now why is your garage parked on top of your vehicles
that's a funny place for a garage isn't it
shall we get it down
the garage that at Christmas time becomes baby Jesus's stable
it was actually baby Jesus's stable first but there we go
actually Warren calls it a shed don't you
yeah
has it broken down
why is it broken down
oh for broken down cars
and vehicles
right
well they're not getting much money in are they because there's no broken down vehicles in it
shall I translate that as broken down Land_Rover
oh right
is the chappie going to come out and mend it
what's he going to do to mend it do you think
pardon
oh put it on the break on there
right
will it fit on there
yeah
it might do
why don't you try
that's right
shall we see if the Land_Rover can drive up onto here then
reversing off
oh it kind of stays on there doesn't it
it's a bit big really
has it been taken away to be mended
could this man not mend it
a broken down lady
let's have a look for a broken down lady
I don't know if you've got a broken down lady actually
have you
oh is this the broken down lady Warren
I've never seen her before
is that the little broken down lady
oh
oh yes
a what on top
a cherry on top
right
is this the broken down lady then
yes
is she going to drive the lorry
will she fit in
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
shall we get her out
don't lean on the top because it might just break the transporter
oh she doesn't want to come out does she
she's waving goodbye to the Land_Rover I think
what's wrong with the Land_Rover
what bit's broken
what needs mending
oh right
is there a hole in the wheel
right
why not
whoops
oh is it a sleepy horse
that's a good place for a sleep isn't it away from all the noisy vehicles
except
the noisy rhino's going to come and wake the horse up
is it not
oh right
is it going to be a quiet rhino tiptoeing past
okay
tiptoe
that's a funny place for a rhinoceros
well what is it then
okay
I was just sort of holding it
I wasn't intending to put it on the car transporter
tiger actually
grr
shocker
don't know where you picked that up from
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
he's too small too big
yeah
the baby tiger would certainly fit on there
but I don't know where the baby tigers are
did the baby tigers go on holiday with us
I think they did didn't they
oh yeah
that shouldn't be in your vehicle box should it
my_goodness
don't have irons in the vehicle box
now what's happened to this bus
that's better
yes
what's wrong with them sitting on the bench
they're having a little rest because they've been working hard mending cars all morning
oh right
yes
okay
next_to the horse
what about the little girl
the ice lady
where's she going to go
do they not
no
oh they do
no
they don't
where is the little girl
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
never mind
well she could sit on the grass couldn't she
that green bit there looks like grass doesn't it
she could sit there
and eat her ice
well she's got a picture of an ice on her jumper hasn't she
it might be magic ice
a magic picture on her jumper
oh that was clever
they've gone under the settee now
no
because they've gone right to the wall at the back
I can see something peeping out
I can see your motorbike under the settee
you can probably reach
no
I can't reach them because they're right at the back of the settee
well you can't have them darling because you've pushed them under the settee
you could have a coast man
get his helicopter out
he could go and rescue some people
where are the rotor
yeah
here you go
because coast go out and rescue people who are stuck on boats in the sea
it is isn't it
he's going to jump into this helicopter quickly so it doesn't get him
why don't you stop the rotor while he climbs in
that's it
then he can go off and rescue some people
mhm
that's a good idea
to take the rotor off
yeah
that's a good idea
who's he going to go and rescue
oh
oh right
he's just checking that everything's working like those ambulance people we saw the other day
oh_my_goodness
I hope he's not hurt
the ambulance came just in_case he was hurt and had to go to hospital
well that was a beautiful spin wasn't it
that span really well
whoops
well it is really isn't it
it looks like there's been a big accident
if you put everything standing up it'll just look as_if they're parked rather than crashed
the key should be in here somewhere so we can wind it up but I don't know where
there it is
what's the matter
right
now you have_to hold it down like that and keep the wheels still while you turn it
no
wrong way
turn it that way towards the front of the engine
right
are you going to let go
that's Bertie
I think I'm sitting on Thomas
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't
you'll have_to wind him up again
well you have_to make sure the wheels are on the ground
right
you keep turning
okay
I'll sit by Gordon
right
here's Gordon
here am I
right
send it to me now
then I can send it back
oh
right
send me the key
oh thank_you
wind it up
one two three four five six seven eight
it has
why don't you send it back to me
it's a bit wild isn't it that engine
the wrong way
that's it
hooray
oh thank_you
thank_you
shall we see how far it'll go
can you move the car transporter as_well
we'll see if it can go onto the
okay
that was a long one wasn't it
no
it's run out_of steam
shall I give you the key
is there
oh there's not enough to make it work though is there
that was a good steamy noise wasn't it
send it back
right
okay
it's a bit keen to go isn't it
a bit like Thomas when he goes out_of the station so quickly that he leaves his guard behind doesn't he
when he leaves his guard behind
obviously not
is it
now that was something out_of you've been framed I think
careful
this train's going to go
okay
it has
thank_you
you'll go far with that patronizing tone
I know
I'm not a very good shot am I
oh well done
that's gone under the settee
pull the settee back in_case there's anything unspeakable in there
I don't think there is
oh are you
oh dear
are you poorly
suck this thermometer
let's see how poorly you are
suck this
oh
this poor little boy's very poorly
we need to get an ambulance
nee
now I wonder what the doctor thinks you need
let's find the doctor
here's the doctor
right
the doctor's going to give you a little prod and a feel to see how you are
prod
let's look into your eyes
what does the doctor say
oh do you know what the doctor says
the doctor says you ought_to get out_of your bed and start playing and you'll soon feel better
you're better now aren't you
excuse me
ouch
that was my knee
that's not funny when you bash things into people's knees
you wouldn't like it if I bashed it into your knee
I know that
ow
no
no
because that hurts Warren
I shall have a bruise on my knee now
yes
where is that cab
there it is
just come here while I pull your trousers up Warren

who's the doctor then
is it one of these funny wheelie creatures
is that the doctor
oh I'd better be careful then if the policeman's come out hadn't I
oh yes
oh we'll need to keep safe hold of that Thomas badge so we can put it in your badge bag to go with your holiday badges
if that policeman is in your mouth you'd better take it out
what's in your mouth
right
don't
that's not a policeman
that's a fireman
where's the policeman or is that what you called the policeman
have you got anything in your mouth
just your tongue
this was what you found was it
and your Thomas badge
right
your badge bag is upstairs
Warren
no
that's because it's gone into the sofa
it's gone down under all the springs
it's slipped right down
going going going going going going going going going going
there might be a creatures down there
might be scary creatures down there
oh you'd blow them away would you
you want Thomas
right
well hop off then
let's get it back
this hasn't been undone for a little while
I don't know what state it's in
where's the badge
can I see it here
no
can I see it down the back without having to undo it
a
there you go
we don't have_to take the whole bed out
that's handy
oh
don't stand on there because there are springs under there and you might damage your feet
move quickly
I'm going to put the cushion down
no
no
willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't willn't

I think it was teddy's birthday and we sang happy_birthday to teddy and put a candle on the table
happy_birthday to nuts
nuts don't have birthdays
they're eaten far too quickly
butterflys certainly don't have birthdays
