Gail
on
her
own
that
is
in

have_to
take
the
horse

would
be
wearing
two
shoes
in

we
took
it

not
we
this
is
the

look
there
that
is
all
of
us
on
the
horse
and
carriage
we

then
took
them
off
it
was
great
was
not
it
can
you

glasses
I
think
does
not
it
that

you
standing
on
a
big
sand

I
should
think
oh

giving
it
a

that
is
Mummy
peeping
through
the

at
you
and
Andy
in
the
cot
oh
Gail
going
to

pretending

he
the
stalk
there
is
Gail
oh
look
Andy
crawling
in
in
the
bath
having

going
going
going
going
going
going
going

do
you
think

called
oh
Snoopy

is
right
they
are
all
the
dogs
that
look
like
that
are
called
Snoopy
what
the
thing
round
his
neck
no
I
do
not
think
so
his
ear
moves
and
his
tail
moves
does
something
move
when
he
goes
along
I
think
it
is
his
tail
is
not
it
push
him
along
and
see
what
moves
is
that
a
noise
that
a
dog
makes
do
you
think
does
Caine
make
that
noise
when
he
goes
along
no
pretty
noise

did
that
dog
sometimes
do
on
holiday
remember
that
dog
