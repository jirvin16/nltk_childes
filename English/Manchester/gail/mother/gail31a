got
writing
on
it
www
that
is
one
thing
that
you
are
pretty
good
at
cutting
when
I
went
to
play
to
help
out
all
the
other
children
could
not
do
it
I
was
most
impressed
not
that
you
cut
anything
very
beautiful
but
at
least
you
have
learnt
how
to
do
it
and
those
scissors
are
pretty
tricky
because
Mummy
cannot
cut
anything
with
them
although
I
think
we
will
have_to
take
them
with
us
well
we
will
take
them
with
us
so_that
you
can
do
cutting

might

need
to
wrap
up
